<p class='line center mt3 mb2'>CHAPTER I</p>

<p>In dim twilight a spark of life glittered, glinted
like a bit of mica catching the sun, on a vast
face of gray cliff above a dead gray sea. There was
nothing else in the world but the vastness and the
grayness of the cliff and the sea, till the spark felt
the faint thrill of warmth which gave to it the knowledge
of its own life. &#8220;I am alive,&#8221; the whisper
stirred, far down in the depths of consciousness.
Next the question came, &#8220;What am I?&#8221;</p>

<p>At first just that infinitesimal bright glint lived
where all the rest was dead, or creation not yet begun.
Then slowly the answer followed the question: &#8220;I
am I. A man. I was a man. I am dead. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>is the twilight between worlds. I must dream back.
I must know myself as I was. Later I shall wake
and know what I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soul was very still, tired after an all-but-forgotten
struggle. It was beginning to remember that
it had suffered infinitely. It was patient, with all
the patience of eternity before it. There was no
hurry. Hurry and turmoil seemed strange and remote,
part of some outworn experience. Lying still,
it passively waited for the dream to begin. For a
moment&mdash;or perhaps years&mdash;there remained only the
gray blankness of the empty world; but the spark of
life grew in brightness as a star grows to visibility
in the pallor of an evening sky. Then, suddenly,
a face flashed into existence&mdash;a girl&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew her. I loved her,&#8221; the soul remembered
with a thrill, like a shooting ray of the star that was
itself. &#8220;Where? Who was she? What were we
to each other?&#8221;</p>

<p>The dream began to take on definiteness. The
soul groped back to find its body and its lost place
in the world. Not this gray limbo, but the sad and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>happy, the glorious and terrible world whence it had
somehow passed.</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s face faded away for an instant, and
the face of a man seemed to be reflected in a blurred
mirror. The eyes of the soul looked into the man&#8217;s
eyes and knew them. They were his own. He was
that man, or had been. &#8220;What a dull dog you are,&#8221;
he heard himself say, as if he had said it long ago,
said it often, and the echo had followed him to this
twilit place beyond death. He thought the face was
rather like a dog&#8217;s, an ugly mongrel dog&#8217;s. The
girl could not possibly care for him! Yet some one
had told him that she did care, and that she would
marry him if he asked. &#8220;I&#8217;m her mother. I ought
to know!&#8221; As he heard the woman&#8217;s voice speaking
the words, he saw the face that belonged to the voice:
the face of a pretty woman, young looking till the
girl came near.... The girl had come now! The
cream-and-rose tints of her youth made the other
face old. This was rather pathetic. He remembered
that it had so impressed him more than once.
Yet he had never been able to like the mother.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>The dream was growing in distinctness. They
three&mdash;he and the girl and the woman&mdash;were in a
house. It was a beautiful old house, in the country.
Outside it was black and white, with elaborate patterns
of oak on plaster. A sheet of water lay so near
that the black and white front was reflected in it,
like a dream within a dream. The calm water was
asleep, and dreaming the house; and some great dark
trees and clumps of rhododendrons were dreaming
also, which seemed very confusing, and made him
doubt whether there were any such soul as his, or
whether after all he were only the spirit of the
water or the trees, and had never known this girl who
was walking with the ugly man. Yet it seemed to
be the ugly man&#8217;s house, and he knew what the man
was thinking. They were one and the same, at all
events in the dream. And though he was out of
doors with the girl, he could see every room in the
house as plainly as he could see the lake and the
trees and the pink rhododendrons. He seemed to
pass through each room, one after another, because
the girl was extolling the charm of the house, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>his mind moved here and there following her words,
picturing her, white and flower-like against a dark
oak paneling, or old brocade, or hanging of faded
tapestry.</p>

<p>Yes, it was a beautiful house. He had that to
offer her, and money too. There were women who
would take him because of what he had to give.
And there was something else. What was it? Oh,
a title. Not much of a title. He couldn&#8217;t believe
she would be influenced by a trifle like that.
She was too perfect, too wonderful. A great
many men with nobler titles and more money must
have asked her to marry them, or they would ask
her in future; for she was still very young. So
far she had never fallen in love. She had told
him so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not seriously in love,&#8221; she had said, half laughing,
and half in earnest. &#8220;There was only my cousin.
I adored him when I was child. But I haven&#8217;t
seen him since I was sixteen. And now I&#8217;m twenty-one.
He was most awfully good looking, and I
thought he was a knight and a hero. Perhaps if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>he came back from India I should be disappointed in
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Queer that the groping soul should hold an echo
of these chance words about India, though there was
none for the name of the cousin, nor even of the
girl herself. This made the awakening man wonder
again if the girl had existed, or whether she lived
only in his dreams. It was a vaguely sweet, vaguely
sad dream, which seemed to have ended before it was
fairly begun, with a very sorrowful ending which he
couldn&#8217;t quite recall yet. He wished to go on
dreaming, and to change the end if he could.</p>

<p>The girl and her mother were visiting the ugly
man at the old black and white house. He&mdash;whoever
he was&mdash;had to go away. He was begging the
girl to stop until he came back. &#8220;If I do come
back,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Your mother is willing to stay
if you are. It would make me happy to think of
you in my house, and if anything happens to
me....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t speak of such things!&#8221; she broke in.
&#8220;It&#8217;s terrible that you must go.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>This was very kind of her, because it was not reasonable
that she could really care much&mdash;such a girl&mdash;for such a man,
who had never been able to interest
her, he felt. But she looked at him, looked up
mistily with her dear eyes of smoke-blue. There
was some message in them, behind a glaze of tears.</p>

<p>Drowned in those eyes, he heard himself stammering
out things he had not thought that he would
ever dare to say. &#8220;If you could marry me ... I
don&#8217;t suppose you could ... but if....&#8221;</p>

<p>Her answer did not come into the dream. Perhaps
she had not answered. But he could see the
ugly man holding out his hands, and the girl putting
her hands into them. He could see her looking up
at him again, and in the beautiful eyes there was
that message she wanted him to read. There, at
that place, was the end of the dream-picture; it never
went further, though he tried over and over to carry
it on; the girl looking up, a tall slender shape in
white, with the afternoon sun burnishing her hair,
and giving to it the color of a copper beech tree under
which she stood. He knew that he had thought,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>&#8220;I shall never forget her as she is now, not even when
I&#8217;m dead.&#8221; He had kept his word. He was dead;
hovering on the borderland of the unknown: and
he had not forgotten. But just where the dream
ended, before he could read the girl&#8217;s look and hear
what she had to say, her mother had come quickly
out of the house, with an open book in her hand.
That seemed to be the reason why the picture broke.</p>

<p>It seemed afterwards too, though there was no
clear vision, that the girl was willing to marry him,
just barely willing. Her mother took it for granted
that she had said &#8220;yes&#8221; when he asked her, and the
girl let it go as if it were true; though he could not
be sure it was what she had meant when she looked
up with the strange light in her eyes, and tried to
speak. He would have given years of the future he
hoped for then, to have been sure, without any
doubts.</p>

<p>When he stammered out his questions he had not
thought of anything better than an engagement, to
end in marriage if he came home safely after the
war.... The war!... Dim remembrance of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>hideous suffering suddenly stirred the slow current
of his dream. There had been war. That was how
it had happened! He had been killed in battle.
Or else, none of the dream was true! There had
been no such man, no such girl, no such black and
white house reflected in a crystal lake. This was a
dream of things that had never been. A veil of unreality
began to fall between him and the picture
he had seen. No, it couldn&#8217;t have been true of his
life, of course, because the dream had begun again,
and was carrying him on to a wedding. The church
in the village ... (he knew that church well, and
the way to it from the big gates and the little gates;
the long way and the short cut) ... The girl, and
a man in khaki were standing together ... the
same ugly man, uglier than ever in his soldier
clothes, he thought. He heard the words which a
clergyman in a white surplice was reading out of
the prayer book. &#8220;To have and to hold, till death
do you part.&#8221; And he saw himself putting a ring
on the girl&#8217;s finger. She held her left hand out to
him&mdash;the long, slim hand he used to think must be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>like St. Cecilia&#8217;s, because of the genius of music in
its finger tips. He could see no following picture
of her alone with him. He saw himself going away,
waving good-by: then a train and a boat, and a train
again, with a crowd of other men, all soldiers.</p>

<p>He was an officer. (He had left the army before
that dream-time, he could not remember why, but
it had something to do with money&mdash;and with the
black and white house: and he had offered himself
again for the war.) In the dream he rode a horse
along a straight sunlit road, with poplars on either
side that gave no shade. There were days of marching
in furnace heat. Then came a night of silver
moonlight reddened by fire; a village burning.
There was a noise as of hell let loose: and since he
had been dead he hated noise. It was the one unbearable
thing. Hearing noise in his dream, the star
which was his soul shattered itself into a thousand
sparks, each spark a red-hot nerve of pain. All
round him in the crowded dream there was fighting.
Smoke stung his eyelids. He breathed it in, and
choked. His horse trampled men down. Their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>cries were in his ears. Some voice he knew called to
him for help. He pulled a man up on his horse; a
friend, he thought it was, some one he cared for.
Now the horse stopped, reared, and fell. By and
by the man whose soul dreamed, struggled to his
feet, dazed, but remembering his friend dragged him
from under the hurt animal. Helmets glittered in
the moonlight. Eyes glinted red in the copper glare.
He fought with a sword and kept off men that
pressed on him and his friend, trying to kill them
both. A stab of pain shot through his hand. A
bugle sounded. Men were running away. He
thought they were men of the enemy; a stream of
helmets going. He heard his own voice shout an
order, but before it could be obeyed a din as of
mountains rent asunder roared his voice down. His
whole being was swallowed up as a raindrop is swallowed
in a cataract. A huge round shape rushed
towards him, black against moonlight and flame.
Then the world burst and tore him in a million fragments....</p>

<p>His soul coming back to knowledge of its continuance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>held the impression that this rending anguish
of death had been long, long ago, thousands of years
ago in time: and that he was now or soon would be
waking into eternity. The breaking of the dream
and the pain he had suffered ought not to seem important.
It ought not to matter to a disembodied
spirit. Yet it did matter terribly. Most of all did
it matter that the girl with the smoke-blue eyes and
copper-beech hair had been swept away from him
forever. She was somewhere in the world he had
left behind. He did not even know her name, or
whether indeed she had really been in his life.
Henceforth he would have to wander through space
and eternity without finding her again.</p>

<p>The man groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming round at last!&#8221; a woman&#8217;s voice
said.</p>

<p>The voice sounded muffled, and far off. It
sounded harsh, too. It was not a sweet voice, and
it was not speaking his language. Through the
gray dimness which hung over him like a cloud,
trickled this impression. He wondered why, if the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>language were not his, he should understand what
the voice said.</p>

<p>&#8220;G-erman,&#8221; he struggled to say, and succeeded
with pain in whispering the word.</p>

<p>Somebody laughed. &#8220;He knows he&#8217;s in German
hands!&#8221; chuckled the same voice.</p>

<p>An agony of regret fell upon him like an ice
avalanche. He was alive, then, whoever he was,
and there had never been a girl with smoke-blue eyes
and copper-beech hair! She was only a dream.
That must be so, because the words she had said to
him were all gone from his mind. He could no
longer remember anything about her except her face&mdash;and those
eyes. Those eyes! His interest in past
and present abruptly ceased. He let himself slide
away into blank oblivion.</p>

<p class='line center mt3 mb2'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>CHAPTER II</p>

<p>Hours or years later he waked up with a start,
and stared at the light. It was daylight,
and he was in an immense room. It seemed big
enough for a theater. Perhaps it was a theater.
The walls had red panels painted on them, and on
each panel one or two cupids danced and threw
flowers: repulsive, stout cupids. The ceiling was
very far up above his eyes, and there was a dome
in the center. From this dome depended a huge
crystal chandelier like a bulbous stalactite. There
were a great many high windows, with panes here
and there opened for ventilation. The windows had
no curtains, and the room had no furniture except
beds&mdash;beds&mdash;endless rows of beds, surely hundreds
of beds.</p>

<p>He lay in one of these. All were occupied. He
could see heads of men whose bodies looked extraordinarily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>flat. On some of the heads were bandages.
Others were shaved, so that they appeared quite
bald. They were very pale heads in the bleak, grayish
light filtering dimly through the high windows.
A number of bunks were hidden by screens. He
wished dully that he had this privacy, but his narrow
bed had been given no such protection.</p>

<p>A man was slowly walking down an aisle between
rows of narrow cots all exactly alike. Beside the
man, who had a remarkably large head with a shock
of rough, straw-colored hair, was a woman dressed
as a nurse. The newly awakened one knew she was
a nurse, though she was not dressed in the costume
familiar to him in some vague past. There were
many in the room wearing the same sort of cap
and apron and prim gown that she wore: young
women, middle-aged women, old women. They
had kind faces, but the watcher saw no beautiful
ones. Not that he cared for that, or anything.</p>

<p>He had not been awake long when a big girl came
towards him, paused, peered, and went away again.
She stopped the nurse who walked with the shock-headed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>man, and spoke to her. The woman&#8217;s cap
and the man&#8217;s tousled hair turned from the direction
they had been taking, and approached his bed.
They bent over it, and he gazed up stupidly at their
faces. The shock-headed man had a beard even
lighter than his hair. He smoothed it with a white,
strong-looking hand, a capable hand, the hand of the
born surgeon. The woman had hard features, but
soft eyes, wistful, and pathetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, he is getting along finely,&#8221; she said to
her companion. &#8220;I think we shall have no more
trouble with him now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man in bed remembered that he had heard
her voice before, and that she had spoken German
then, as now. He did not wonder this time why
he understood what she said, though the language
was not his own. He remembered that he had
learned German when he was a boy, and had hated
learning it because of the verbs.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you feel?&#8221; the surgeon enquired, in
English.</p>

<p>The man in bed tried to answer. His voice came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>in a weak whisper. This surprised him, and made
him ashamed. &#8220;Very&mdash;well,&#8221; he heard himself
say, as he had seemed to hear himself speak in the
dream which was gone now, far away, out of reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said the surgeon. &#8220;Can you tell me
your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sick man thought for a moment, and the question
went echoing through his brain as a voice calling
one who is absent echoes through a deserted
house. Knowledge of his helplessness brought a
sense of physical disintegration, as if the marrow of
his bones was melting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind!&#8221; the shock-headed surgeon said, in
a quiet, reassuring tone. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right. You&#8217;ll
remember by and by, when you&#8217;re stronger. Don&#8217;t
worry about yourself. I&#8217;ve performed an operation
on you, which is known as trepanning. That was
some days ago. It has been a success. But we will
let you rest a while longer before we bother you
with questions. The only thing is, the sooner we
learn your name the sooner we can take steps to let
your people hear that you&#8217;re alive. It&#8217;s a long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>time since you were wounded: eight months. We
couldn&#8217;t operate on your head till now. There were
too many other things to mend about you! <i>Somebody</i>
must be anxious. Go to sleep again when
you&#8217;ve had your food, and perhaps the past will all
come back to your mind. But if it doesn&#8217;t, don&#8217;t
make an effort. That will do you harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sick man expressed his thanks with the faint
ghost of a smile. When the nurse had fed him with
warm liquid, which he drank through a tube without
lifting his bandaged head from the pillow, he closed
his eyes and tried to find his way into the dream
again. But the door of the dream was shut. He
could see only the face of the girl. She alone remained
to him, as if she had lingered and found herself
locked out when the dream-door shut. She had
no name, and he had none. But that seemed to be
of little importance. It was easy to obey the surgeon
and not make an effort. The difficult thing
would have been to struggle toward any end. He
felt that to do so would shatter his brain. And as
he was very sure nobody cared what had become of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>him, there was no need. Why he was so sure of
this, he could not tell. But something inside him,
which remembered things <i>he</i> had forgotten, was absolutely
sure.</p>

<p>How long his lethargy of mind and body lasted,
he did not know. Days faded grayly into nights,
and nights brightened grayly into days. Neither
the surgeon nor the two nurses who had charge of
him asked further questions. He took no real interest
in anything except the effort to find his way
back into the lost dream, which he could never do;
and sometimes even the beloved face was blotted
out. But at last, the objective began to dominate
the subjective in the man. He gave a little thought
to his surroundings. He noticed his neighbors who
occupied the beds near him, and listened dully when
they talked to the nurses. They were all Germans.
One day he asked the nurse with the patient eyes,
if there were any other Englishmen besides himself
in her charge. And as he spoke the word, with
confidence which he could not analyze, it sent a
faint thrill through his veins, a sense of unity with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>something. &#8220;Englishmen!&#8221; He was an Englishman.</p>

<p>He had to speak in German, for the nurse had no
other language. Oddly enough, it seemed easy to
make her understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had four Englishmen with you when you
came,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;They are&mdash;gone now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He understood that they were dead, and that she
did not like to tell him so. He smiled faintly, but
asked no more questions then.</p>

<p>Next, he wanted to know where the hospital was,
and how long he had been in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in Brussels,&#8221; the nurse told him. &#8220;This
used to be a restaurant. All the hospitals were full.
You have been here only a few weeks, but we had
heard of you, for yours was a wonderful case.
Many doctors have talked about it. Just before
your operation, you came to us. You were brought
to Herr Doctor Schwarz for that. He is a great
man for the brain. You were lucky to have him to
operate. It was thought you might be an officer,
because you spoke both German and French, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>you didn&#8217;t know what you were saying. A bit of
bone pressed on the brain. Your head had been
hurt. And you had many other wounds, which another
great surgeon had cured, when every one else
said you would surely die. That was why they
waited so long before operating on your brain.
You had suffered so much already. You had to
grow strong after what you had gone through, and
get over the nerve-shock, which was worst of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see, how long did Dr. Schwarz tell me it
was, before they operated?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eight months,&#8221; the nurse answered reluctantly,
as if she feared to excite him, yet saw no real reason
why, now that he was getting well, he might not
hear all the truth about himself. Besides, it might
help him to remember the past. She knew that
Dr. Schwarz was anxious for him to do so now. He
had always been an extremely interesting and rather
mysterious &#8220;case,&#8221; sent from a distance by a brother
surgeon to Schwarz, and specially recommended to
his attention. &#8220;Eight months,&#8221; the woman repeated.
&#8220;I think you were wounded in some battle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>early in August. We have the record that came
from the first hospital where you were. Now it is
the 15th of April.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eight months,&#8221; the man counted dreamily with
his fingers. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t they know whether or not
I was an officer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was like this,&#8221; the nurse explained, with her
stolid yet kindly and truthful look; &#8220;it was like
this: Your cavalry and our cavalry fought.
That is the account we have, though it is not very
clear. You were getting the better of us, but our
artillery came up and our Uhlans were ordered to
retreat. When they were safely out of the way,
your lancers were shelled. I think they were cut to
pieces. Nobody on either side could get at the dead
and wounded for days. When they did go to help
the living, it was our Germans who went. Most
of the English were killed. You and the others who
lived (unless a few escaped), were brought to a hospital
of ours, in the north of France. Our soldiers
would not do such a thing, so it must have been
prowling people&mdash;thieves&mdash;who stripped off your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>clothes. One reason why our doctors thought you
might be an officer, even before you spoke, was because
the little finger of your left hand had been
partly cut off. It had been done with a knife.
That seemed as if you must have worn a valuable
ring, so tight it couldn&#8217;t be got off in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother&#8217;s ring,&#8221; muttered the man. The
words spoke themselves. Again, it was not he who
remembered, but something which seemed to be separate
and independent, hiding inside him, though not
in his brain. It knew all about him, but would not
give up the secret. Impishly, it threw out a sop of
knowledge now and then, just as it pleased. The
nurse tried to encourage this Something to go on,
but it would not be coaxed. When she repeated the
conversation to Schwarz afterwards, however, he
said, &#8220;That&#8217;s encouraging. Don&#8217;t press him too
much. Let body and brain recover tone. Then
we&#8217;ll try more suggestions. It&#8217;s the most interesting
case we&#8217;ve had. What is it to me that he&#8217;s
friend or enemy? Nothing. He&#8217;s a man. I shall
think of a way to set up the right vibrations.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>The way he thought of was to commandeer a
bundle of English papers which had been passing
from hand to hand in Brussels. These papers had
been smuggled into the town by a German who had
escaped from a concentration camp in England. He
was a doctor, and had got into Belgium through
Holland. Such newspapers as he had were very old
ones, but that did not matter, because the man in
whom Schwarz, the surgeon, was interested had lost
touch with the world since a day soon after the
breaking out of war. He must have been among the
first troops sent over from England to France, and
rushed straight to the front.</p>

<p>For a few days he had been very silent, asking no
questions. He seemed always to be thinking. By
Schwarz&#8217;s orders he was left alone. Then, one
morning, he was surprised by the news that he was
well enough to sit up. When he had been propped
with pillows, the nurse he liked best&mdash;the one with
the hard features and soft eyes&mdash;slipped a roll of
dilapidated newspapers under the listless hands that
lay on the turned-over sheet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>&#8220;English,&#8221; she said, and saw that his eyes brightened.</p>

<p class='dots'>&nbsp;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

<p>His left hand, with the tell-tale mutilated finger,
began painfully to open out the heavy roll. He
could not help much with the other hand, for his
right arm had been so injured that it had been
strapped to his side for weeks, and the muscles had
withered. They would recover tone, and the arm
its strength, Schwarz prophesied, but he was only
just beginning again to use his right hand.</p>

<p>This was the first time he had read anything except
the notices posted up on the hospital walls,
which forbade loud talking and other offenses. To
see the <i>Illustrated London News</i> and the <i>Daily Mail</i>
and the <i>Chronicle</i>, dated on days of September, made
him feel more than ever that he had died, and come
back to earth on sufferance as a ghost. For him
there had been no autumn nor winter. The world
had ended on a hot night in August. There had
been summer, and then blackness. Now it was
spring.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>September 10th. September 11th. September
13th.</p>

<p>The <i>Illustrated London News</i> lay on top. He
laid back the cover. There was a battle scene on
the first page. It looked vaguely familiar. British
lancers and helmeted German Uhlans were fighting
furiously together. Apparently it was night.
The background was lit by flames from a burning
village. It was an impressionist effect, well presented.
The man felt very tired and old as he
looked at the picture. Pains throbbed through his
head and body and limbs, reminding him of each
wound now healed. He turned over the page and
several others. Near the middle of the paper he
opened to one entirely given up to small photographs
of officers. &#8220;Dead on the Field of Honor,&#8221;
he read. Under each portrait were a few lines of
fine print. He began with the left-hand side, at
the top. Faces of strangers. Then two he recognized,
with a leap of the heart. One had been an
acquaintance, one an old friend. Their names
rushed back to him, as if spoken by their own voices,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>even before he had time to read. Human interests
surged round him as he lay, every-day interests of
life as he had laid it down. &#8220;Dear old Charley
Vance. Dead! And Willoughby....&#8221;</p>

<p>A photograph in the middle of the page seemed
to tear itself from the paper and jump at his eyes.
It was larger than the others grouped round it....
&#8220;Good God!&#8221; broke from his lips.</p>

<p>He glanced around, startled. He was afraid that
he had screamed the words. But evidently he had
not made any sound. No one was noticing him.
Most of the men near by, all surgical cases, were
resting quietly. Several nurses were talking at a
distance, their broad, reliable backs turned his way.</p>

<p>It was his own photograph he was looking at ...
the face of the ugly man he had seen in the lost
dream, as in a dim mirror. Underneath was a name.
He would <i>know</i>, now&mdash;his own name, and&mdash;the rest.
All his blood seemed to pour away from his heart.
A queer mist swam before his eyes. He tried to
wink it away, but could not, and had to wait till it
faded, leaving a slow shower of silver sparks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>&#8220;Killed in action, on the night of August 18th, Sir
John Denin, 16th baronet, Captain &mdash;th Lancers,
aged 32. See paragraph on following page.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man turned the leaf over. There was the
paragraph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Sir John Richard Stuart Denin, killed
in the fatal night fighting near <span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>, where his regiment
was caught by the enemy&#8217;s artillery fire in a
wood, was a well-known figure in the world. It
will be remembered that on the death of his uncle,
Sir Stuart Denin, from whom the title passed to him,
the unentailed estates were left by will to a distant
cousin and favorite of the late baronet. Sir John
was advised by his friends to contest the will, but
refused to do so, saying his uncle had every right to
dispose of his property as he chose. This generosity
was considered quixotic, but had a romantic reward
a few months later when an aunt of the new baronet&#8217;s
mother bequeathed him one of the most beautiful
and historic of the ancient black and white
houses in Cheshire, Gorston Old Hall, and half a
million pounds. On receiving this windfall of fortune
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>which was entirely unexpected, it will be recalled
that Sir John resigned from the army, he being
at the time a first lieutenant in the &mdash;th Lancers.
Two years later, on the outbreak of the war, he at
once offered his services, which were accepted, and
he was given a captaincy in his old regiment, leaving
for the front with the first of our Expeditionary
Force, and he was, unhappily, also among the first
to fall. On the day of his departure Sir John was
quietly married at his own village church in Gorston,
Cheshire, to Miss Barbara Fay of California, U.S.A.,
who is thus left a widow without having been a
wife. Everything he possessed, including Gorston
Old Hall, passes by the will of the deceased officer
to his widow. As Miss Fay, Lady Denin was considered
one of the most beautiful American girls ever
presented to their Majesties, she having made her
début at an early court in the spring of 1913, or a
little over a year before her wedding and widowhood.
The mother of Lady Denin, though married
to an American professor of Egyptology who died
some years ago, has English blood in her veins; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>is a near relative of Captain Trevor d&#8217;Arcy of
the&mdash;th Gurkhas, now on the way to France with his
gallant regiment. Captain d&#8217;Arcy&#8217;s photograph
taken with his men at the time of the Durbar, appears
on the following page, also that of the newly
widowed Lady Denin. In the battle where Captain
Sir John Denin met his death, he greatly distinguished
himself by gallant conduct, and to him
would have been due a signal success had not the
German artillery rescued the defeated Uhlans and
followed up their flight with a withering fire. Sir
John succeeded in saving the life of his first lieutenant,
the Honble. Eric Mantell, who was one of the
few to escape this massacre, and who had the sad
privilege of identifying his preserver&#8217;s mutilated
body on the battlefield. Sir Eric had recovered sufficiently
from his wounds to be present at the funeral,
the remains of the dead hero having after some
unavoidable delay been brought to England and
buried in Gorston churchyard. Had Sir John lived,
it is said that he would have been recommended for
the Victoria Cross.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>The man who had died and been buried, whose
body had been identified by his friend and taken
home, fell back on the thin hospital pillow, and
closed his eyes. He felt as if he had come to a blank
wall, stumbled against it, and fallen. Then, suddenly,
he realized that by turning over a page, he
could see <i>her</i> face&mdash;the face of his wife.</p>

<p class='line center mt3 mb2'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>CHAPTER III</p>

<p>He turned the page, but for a moment it was
a blank, blurred surface, as if everything on
it had been blocked out by order of the censor. He
found himself counting his own heart-beats, and it
was only as they slowed down that the page cleared,
and the eyes he had seen in the lost dream looked
up at him from the paper.</p>

<p>They gave him back himself. A thousand details
of the past rushed upon him in a galloping army.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Denin, widow of Captain Sir John Denin,&#8221;
he read. &#8220;She is shown in this photograph in her
presentation dress, as Miss Barbara Fay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barbara had disliked the photograph. He could
see it now, in a silver frame on her mother&#8217;s writing
desk, in the drawing-room of the little furnished
house taken for the season in London. He had been
shown into that room when he made his first call.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>Mrs. Fay had asked him to come, just when he was
wondering how to get the invitation. And Mrs.
Fay had given him one of those photographs. It
occurred to him that she must also have given one
to the newspaper. Barbara would not have wished
it to be published. But he had thought it beautiful,
and he thought it more than ever beautiful now.</p>

<p>His wife&mdash;no, his widow! That was what the
paper said: &#8220;Lady Denin, widow of Captain Sir
John Denin.&#8221; What would she do, what would she
say, if she could see the wreck of John Denin, in a
German hospital in Belgium, staring hungrily at her
picture?</p>

<p>He asked himself this, and answered almost without
hesitation. She was so loyal, so fine, that she
would not grudge him his life. She would even try,
perhaps, to think she was glad that he lived. Yet
she could not in her secret heart, be glad. Such
gladness would not be natural to human nature.
She had been hurried into marrying him, partly because
he loved her and was going away to fight,
partly because her mother urged it as the best solution
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>of her difficulties. Now, all things Mrs. Fay
had wanted for the girl were hers without the one
drawback; the plain, dull fellow who had to be
taken with them&mdash;the fly in the ointment, the pill in
the jam. Barbara had dearly loved the old black
and white house. She had said so a dozen times.
She had never once said that she loved John Denin.
She had only smiled and been kind, and looked at
him in a baffling way, with that mysterious message
in her eyes which he had been too stupid to read.
Mrs. Fay had loved the house too, and the whole
place; and it was hard to believe in looking back,
that she had not loved the money, and the idea of a
title for her beautiful girl.</p>

<p>John Denin, who ought to have died and had not
died, asked himself what was now the next best thing
to do. Also he asked the eyes in the photograph,
but they seemed gently to evade his eyes, just as they
had often evaded them in life.</p>

<p>Next on the page to Barbara&#8217;s picture was the portrait
of her cousin, Captain d&#8217;Arcy, of whom she had
spoken more than once, the &#8220;hero and knight&#8221; of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>childhood. He looked a handsome enough fellow
in his uniform, though hardly of the &#8220;hero and
knight&#8221; type. He was too full-fleshed for that: a
big, low-browed, thick-lipped man of thirty-six or
seven, who would think a great deal of himself and
his own pleasure. Evidently he had changed since
the days when he was the ideal hero of a sixteen-year-old
girl. Denin, scarred and wrecked, a bit of
human driftwood, was dimly shocked at the mean
pleasure had in this thought. Barbara&mdash;wife or
widow&mdash;was unlikely to feel her old love rekindle
at sight of her cousin, and Denin was glad&mdash;glad.
Barbara was not a girl to fall in love easily. But, if
she believed herself free, she might some day....</p>

<p>A spurt of fire darting up his spine seemed to burn
the base of his brain. It struck him almost with
horror that the question he had been asking a few
minutes ago had answered itself. No matter how
undesirable he might be as a husband, he must for
Barbara&#8217;s own sake force the fact of his continued
existence upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as I can control my hand enough to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>hold a pencil, I&#8217;ll write to her&mdash;or her mother. Or
perhaps I&#8217;ll try to telegraph, if that&#8217;s possible from
here,&#8221; he thought. Poor Barbara! Poor Mrs. Fay!
It would be a blow to them, and&mdash;yes, by Jove, to
Frank Denin, his cousin. Poor Frank, too! He
had got the Denin estates and the money which
ought to have gone with the baronetcy, and then by
an extra stroke of luck the title had fallen to him,
on top of all the rest. It would be a wrench for him
to give it up after more than eight months of enjoyment.
Then there was that pretty American girl,
Miss VanKortland, to whom poor old Frank had
proposed time after time. All his money and the
two big places had made no difference to her. She
had plenty of money of her own. She had seemed
to like Frank Denin, but she was a desperate flirt
and had always said that if she ever married out of
her own country, it would be a man with a title.
It was Kathryn VanKortland who had introduced
Sir John Denin to Barbara Fay at a dance, not long
after Barbara&#8217;s presentation. John had felt grateful
to Kathryn for that, and indirectly grateful to Frank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>because if it hadn&#8217;t been for him he would not have
been invited to Miss VanKortland&#8217;s dance. How
strangely, vividly, yet dreamily those days and
everything that had happened in them came back
to him, while the people whose faces he called up
thought of him in his grave! He wondered how
it was that Eric Mantell had escaped, and how Eric
came to believe that he had identified John Denin&#8217;s
body. He wondered also whether, now that Frank
Denin was &#8220;Sir Frank,&#8221; Kathryn VanKortland had
changed her mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could make the title over to Frank,&#8221; the
man in the hospital cot said to himself. &#8220;God
knows I don&#8217;t value it for myself, and I don&#8217;t believe
Barbara does. But it can&#8217;t be. And there&#8217;s
just one thing to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>There seemed to the weary brain of the invalid,
however, no great hurry about doing the one thing.
Barbara was certainly not grieving for him. There
was no one else to care very much except some of the
old servants, and he had remembered all of them in
his will before going to the front. As for Frank, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>a way it would be a good thing for him if he could
secure Kathryn before the news came bereaving him
of the baronetcy. The girl could not leave him if
they were married, or even throw him over with decency
if they were engaged. Besides, Denin wanted
to write the letter himself. He would not trust the
task to one of the nurses, and had confided to no one
yet the fact that memory of his past had come back.
He was only just beginning to use his right hand
for a few minutes at a time. It would be a week at
the least, before he could write even a short letter
without help.</p>

<p>Two days went by, and the surgeon&#8217;s orders to
&#8220;let him alone,&#8221; so that he might &#8220;come round of his
own accord,&#8221; were still observed. Nobody questioned
the invalid about himself, though the nurses
said to each other that he had &#8220;begun to think.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the third day, a wounded British aviator was
brought into his ward. The news ran about like
wildfire, and Denin soon learned that a fellow countryman
of his had arrived. The aviator, it seemed,
had been in the act of dropping bombs on some railway
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>bridge which meant the cutting of important
communications, when he had been brought down
with his monoplane, by German guns. Both his
legs were broken, but otherwise he was not seriously
hurt.</p>

<p>Denin enquired of a nurse who the man was, and
heard that he was Flight Commander Walter Severne.</p>

<p>The sound of that name brought a faint thrill.
Denin did not know Walter Severne, but he had met
an elder brother of his, who was one of the first and
cleverest military airmen of England. It was probable
that Walter Severne might have seen John
Denin somewhere, or his photograph&mdash;if only the
photograph in that copy of the <i>Illustrated London
News</i>, which had labeled him as &#8220;dead on the field
of honor.&#8221; If his scars had not changed him past
casual recognition, Severne would be likely to know
him again, and it occurred to Denin that to be identified
in such a way would not be a bad thing. Besides,
if the aviator had not been away from England
long, he might possibly have news to give of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>Barbara&mdash;and Frank&mdash;and Kathryn VanKortland.</p>

<p>They were more or less in the same set, in the
normal days of peace which seemed so long ago.
He asked permission, when he was got up for his
hour out of bed, to talk to the wounded Englishman,
and was told that he might do so, provided that an
English-speaking nurse was near enough to hear
everything they said to each other.</p>

<p>Denin&#8217;s progress along the ward was slow. He
had not been an invalid eight months for nothing,
and the mending of his splintered bones and torn
muscles was hardly short of a miracle, as surgeons
and nurses reminded him frequently, with glee. He
moved with a crutch, and one foot could not yet be
allowed to touch ground, though Schwarz gaily assured
him that some fine day he might be as much
of a man as ever again, thanks to his enemies&#8217; skill
and care. Severne had been told that an Englishman
who had lost his memory through injuries to the
head, and forgotten his own name, was coming to
talk to him. Lying flat on his back with both legs
in plaster-of-Paris, the aviator looked up expectantly;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>but no light of recognition shone in his eyes
when the tall form in hospital pajamas hobbled into
his range of vision.</p>

<p>Denin did not know whether to be relieved or
disappointed. Certainly he was not surprised, for
he had asked for a mirror that morning, and had
studied his marred face during a long, grim moment.
From temple to jaw on the left side it was scarred
with a permanent red scar. A white seam where
stitches had been, ran through the right eyebrow. A
glancing bit of shrapnel had cleft his square chin
precisely in the center, giving a queer effect as of a
deep dimple which had not been there before August
18th; and his thick black hair was threaded with gray
at both temples.</p>

<p>A chair was given to him, in which to sit by the
newcomer&#8217;s bedside. Severne was very young and,
it seemed to Denin in contrast with that new vision
of himself, as beautiful as a girl. Warned that the
other man had lost his memory, the wounded aviator
was pityingly careful not to ask questions. He
talked cheerfully about his own adventures, and said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>that he had been &#8220;at home&#8221; on leave only a week
ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;At home!&#8221; Denin echoed. &#8220;What was it like&mdash;over there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awfully jolly,&#8221; said Severne. &#8220;Not that they
don&#8217;t care, or aren&#8217;t thinking about us, every minute,
night and day. But you know how our people are.
They make the best of things; they have their own
kind of humor&mdash;and we understand. Fact is, I&mdash;went
over to get married. I suppose&mdash;er&mdash;you
never knew the Lacy-Wilmots of Devonshire?
They&#8217;re neighbors of ours. I married the second
daughter, Evelyn. I&mdash;we had two days together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were lucky,&#8221; said Denin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think so? Well, we didn&#8217;t look at it like that.
I wrote to her this morning. Hope she&#8217;ll get the
letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some fellows had only an hour or two with their
brides, I heard,&#8221; Denin said, almost apologetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Severne. &#8220;Jove! There
are shoals of war brides, poor girls, and as brave
as they make &#8217;em, every one!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>&#8220;What about&mdash;the war widows?&#8221; Denin ventured,
stumbling slightly over the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re brave too, all right. But I expect there
are some broken hearts. Not all, though, by any
means. Damn it, no! Lady Denin, for instance.
Did you ever hear of her? I mean, did you ever
hear of John Denin? <i>They</i> had about an hour of
being married before he went off with the first lot
in August, poor chap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about Denin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you didn&#8217;t know him, then? Why should
you? I didn&#8217;t myself, but he belonged to one or
two clubs with my brother Bob. I may have seen
him myself. Awfully fine chap. Everybody liked
him, though he was close as a clam&mdash;no talker.
Came into a ripping place and piles of oof a few
years ago. Not much on looks, though he was an
A1 sportsman and athlete. Girls thought him a big
catch. I&#8217;ve heard plenty say so. Well, he married
an American girl, a beauty, the day he left for the
front, and about a fortnight later she was a widow
with everything he had, made over to her. That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>wasn&#8217;t much above eight months ago. But the day
Evie and I were tied up, the first of last week, Lady
Denin married her cousin, d&#8217;Arcy of the &mdash;th Gurkhas.
Quick work&mdash;what? No heartbreak there!&#8221;</p>

<p>As there came no answer, Severne supposed that
his visitor felt no interest in this bit of gossip apropos
of war widows. He glanced up from his hard, flat
pillow at the other man, and saw what he took for a
far-away look on the scarred face. To change the
subject to one more congenial, the aviator began to
chat of things at the front; but almost instantly the
English-speaking nurse intervened. The two invalids
had talked long enough. Both must rest.
They could see each other again next day.</p>

<p>Without any protest, and scarcely saying good-by,
Denin dragged himself back to his own part of
the ward. &#8220;&#8216;Nobody home!&#8217; The poor fellow
looks as if he wasn&#8217;t all there yet.&#8221; Severne excused
the seeming rudeness of the nameless one.</p>

<p>Denin had not had his full hour of freedom from
bed, but he declared that he was tired and that his
head ached, so he was allowed to lie down. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>turned his face to the wall, and appeared to sleep,
but never had he been more vividly awake.</p>

<p>His plan had fallen into ruin with one bewildering
crash. The corner-stone had been torn out from
the foundation. His duty&mdash;or what he had seen
as his duty&mdash;was changed. After all, Barbara had
not been disappointed in her cousin. She had found
him her &#8220;knight and her hero&#8221; as of old. She had
loved the man so passionately that she had given herself
to him after only eight months of widowhood.
If he had heard this thing of a woman other than
Barbara, Denin would have been revolted. It
could only have looked like an almost defiant admission
that there was no love in the first marriage&mdash;nothing but interest.
He could not, would not,
however, think that Barbara&#8217;s act was a proof of
hardness. Lying on his bed, with his face to the
blank white wall, he began to make desperate excuses
for the girl.</p>

<p>She had married him by special license at three
days&#8217; notice eight months ago, hurried into a decision
by his love, and perhaps the glamour of war&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>red light. Her mother, too, had given her no peace
until she made up her mind. For the hundredth
time he assured himself of that fact. And as for
the well-nigh indecent haste of the second wedding;
why, after all, was it so much worse than the first?</p>

<p>Her marriage with him, John Denin, had been a
marriage only in name. She was left a girl, with
no memories of wifehood. No doubt this new giving
of herself had been another &#8220;war wedding.&#8221;
Trevor d&#8217;Arcy in his picture looked like a man who
would do his best to seize whatever he wanted. He
had of course been going away, perhaps after being
wounded and nursed by Barbara. It would be
natural, very natural, for her to feel that she would
be happier when d&#8217;Arcy was at the front, if they belonged
to each other. Denin told himself savagely
that it would be brutal to blame the girl. She had a
right to love and joy, and she should have both, unspoiled.
He would be damned sooner than snatch
happiness from Barbara, and drag her through the
dust of shame, a woman claimed as wife by two men.</p>

<p>&#8220;This decides things for me, then, forever and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>ever,&#8221; he thought, a strange quietness settling down
upon him, like a cloud in which a man is lost on a
mountain-top. &#8220;She&#8217;s free as light. John Denin
died last August in France.&#8221;</p>

<p class='line center mt3 mb2'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>CHAPTER IV</p>

<p>But the man in the German hospital did not
die. He could not, unless he put an end to
his own life, and to do that had always seemed
to Denin an act of cowardice and weakness. He remembered
reading as a boy, how Plato said that
men were &#8220;prisoners of the gods&#8221; and had no right
to run away from fate. For some reason those
words had made a deep imprint upon his mind at
the time, and the impression remained. His soul
dwelt in his body as a prisoner of the gods, a prisoner
on parole.</p>

<p>Life&mdash;mere physical life&mdash;rose again in his veins
as the days went on, rose in a strong current, as the
sap rises in trees when winter changes to spring.
He was discharged from the hospital as cured, and
interned in a concentration camp in Germany not
far from the Dutch frontier. Though he had given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>his parole to the gods, he would not give it to the
Germans. He meant to escape some day if he could.
He limped heavily, and had not got back the full
strength of his once shattered right hand, so there
was no hope of returning to fight under a new name.
Had there been a chance of that, he would have
wished to join the French Foreign Legion, where a
man can be of use as a soldier, while lost to the world.
As it was, he made no definite plans, but set about
earning money in order not to be penniless if the day
ever came when he could snatch at freedom.</p>

<p>He had always had a marked talent for quick
character-sketches and a bold kind of portraiture.
He could catch a likeness in a moment. With charcoal
he dashed off caricatures of his fellow prisoners,
on the whitewashed wall of the room which he
shared with several British soldiers. The striking
cleverness of the sketcher was noticed by the man
in charge who spoke to some one higher in authority;
and officers came to gaze gravely at the curious works
of art. Denin had rechristened himself by this
time &#8220;John Sanbourne.&#8221; Sanbourne seemed to him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>an appropriate name for one without an aim in life,
and as for &#8220;John,&#8221; without that standby he would
have felt like a man who has thrown away his
clothes. Sanbourne&#8217;s charcoal sketches, therefore,
began to be talked about; and officers brought him
paper and colored chalks, bargaining with him for
a few German war notes, to take their portraits. By
the end of May he had saved up two hundred marks,
accumulated in this way, charging from five to
twenty marks for a sketch, according to size and detailed
magnificence of uniform.</p>

<p>Not having given his parole, he was carefully
watched at first, but as time went on his lameness,
his exemplary conduct, and air of stoical resignation
deceived his guards. One dark night he slipped
away, contrived to pass the frontier, bribed a Dutch
fisherman to sell him clothing, and after a week of
starvation and hardship limped boldly into Rotterdam.
There he parted with the remainder of his
earnings (save a few marks) for a third-class ticket
to New York, trusting to luck that he might earn
money on board as he had earned money in camp,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>enough at least to be admitted as an emigrant into
the United States. Those few marks which he kept,
he invested in artist&#8217;s materials, and on shipboard
soon made himself something of a celebrity in a small
way. He was nicknamed &#8220;the steerage Sargent,&#8221;
and with an hour or two of work every day put together
nearly sixty American dollars during the voyage.
That sum satisfied him. He refused further
commissions, for a great new obsession dominated
his whole being, preoccupying every thought. Absorbed
in it, he found his portrait-making exasperating
work. Something within him that he did not
understand but was forced to obey, commanded the
writing of a book&mdash;the book, not of his life or of
his outside experiences, but of his heart.</p>

<p>He had no idea of publishing this book after it
was written. Indeed, at the beginning, such an idea
would have been abhorrent to him. It would have
been much like profaning a sanctuary. But there
were thoughts which seemed to be in his soul, rather
than in his brain, so intimate a part of himself were
they; and these thoughts beat with strong wings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>against the barrier of silence, like fierce wild birds
against the bars of a cage.</p>

<p>So ignorant was John Denin of book-writing that
he did not know at all how long it would take to put
on paper what he felt he had to give forth. He
knew only that he must say what was in him to say;
and every moment when he was not writing he
chafed to get back to his book again. Indeed, it was
but his body which parted from the manuscript even
when he ate, or walked, or slept. His real self was
writing on and on, every instant, after he had gone
to bed, and most of all, while he dreamed. The
idea for the book, when it sprang into his mind, was
full-grown as Minerva born from the brain of Jove.
Denin felt as if he were a sculptor who sees his statue
buried deep in a marble block, and has but to hew
away the stone to set the image free. He got up
each morning at dawn, bathed, dressed hurriedly,
and worked till breakfast time, when a cup of tea
and a piece of bread were all he wanted or felt he
had time to take. Then, in some out-of-the-way, uncomfortable
corner where his fellow travelers of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>steerage were not likely to interrupt him, he wrote on
often till evening, without stopping to eat at noon.
He used ship&#8217;s stationery begged from the second
class, sheets off his own drawing pads, and small
blank books that happened to be for sale in the wonderful
collection of things ships&#8217; barbers always have.
Sometimes he scribbled fast with one pencil after
another: sometimes he scratched painfully along with
a bad pen. But nothing mattered, if he could write.
And nothing disturbed him; no noise of yelling
laughter, no shouting game, no crying of babies, nor
blowing of bugles.</p>

<p>&#8220;When that chap&#8217;s got his nose to his paper, he
wouldn&#8217;t hear Gabriel&#8217;s trump,&#8221; one man said of
him to another. Everybody asked everybody else
what he was doing when he suddenly stopped his
traffic of portraits; but nobody dared put such a
question to him. Some people guessed that he was
a journalist in disguise, who had been in the war-zone,
and was working against time to get his experiences
onto paper before the ship docked at New
York. But, as a matter of fact, it did not occur to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>Denin to wonder when he should finish until, suddenly
and to his own surprise, the strange story he
had been writing&mdash;if it could be called a story&mdash;came
to its inevitable climax. His message was finished.
There was no more that he wished to say.</p>

<p>This was at twelve o&#8217;clock one night, and the next
morning at six the ship passed the Statue of Liberty.</p>

<p>Denin felt dazed among his fellow emigrants, all
of whom were of a different class in life from his,
and all of whom seemed to have something definite
to expect, something which filled them with excitement
or perhaps hope, making them talk fast, and
laugh as the immense buildings of New York loomed
picturesquely out of the silver mist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Othello&#8217;s occupation&#8217;s gone,&#8221; he found himself
muttering as he leaned on the rail, a lonely figure
among those who had picked up friendships on the
voyage. He realized that he had been almost happy
while he was writing his story. Now that it was
finished and had to be put aside, he had nothing to
look forward to. He was indeed <i>sans bourne</i>.</p>

<p>What the other steerage passengers did on landing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>he did also. Vaguely it appealed to his sense of
humor (which had slept of late) that he, Sir John
Denin, should have his tongue looked at and questions
put to him concerning his means, character, and
purpose in coming from Europe to the United States.
He went through the ordeal with good nature, and
passed doctors and inspectors without difficulty.
When he was free, he joined a couple of elderly Belgians
to whom he had talked on shipboard, and with
them set forth in search of a cheap lodging-house,
where he might stay until he made up his mind what
work he was fit to try for, and do. He was a poor
man now, and could not afford to live in idleness
for more than a few days. He realized this, also that
a &#8220;job&#8221; of any kind was hard to get, and doubly
hard for him since he was not trained for clerical
work or strong enough at the moment to undertake
manual labor. Still, he could not resist the intense
desire he had to shut himself up and read the book
which, when he thought of it, seemed to have written
itself. He had always gone on and on, never stopping
to glance back or correct; and he had a queer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>feeling that the story would be a revelation to him,
that help and comfort and strength would come to
him from its pages.</p>

<p>The Belgians remained in the lodging-house only
long enough to unpack a few things. They then
went out together to see New York, and visit an
agency which had been recommended to them. But
Denin shut himself up as he had longed impatiently
to do, in the tiny back room he had engaged, on the
top floor of a dreary house. There he took from the
cheap bag bought in Rotterdam&mdash;his one piece of
luggage&mdash;the oddly assorted pages of manuscript
which made up a thick packet. With the moment
that he began to read, the stained walls and the
dirty window with a fire-escape outside vanished as
if some genie had rubbed a lamp.</p>

<p>The story was of a soldier and his love for a girl
who did not greatly care for him. She married him
rather than send him away empty-hearted to the
front, cold with disappointment, when it was in her
power to arm him with happiness. They parted on
the day of the wedding. The soldier went to France
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>and was killed in his first fight. The girl grieved because
it had not been possible to love the man with
her whole heart, and because he had had no time (so
she believed) to taste the joy she had sacrificed herself
to give. But the man, going into battle and
afterwards dying on the battlefield, was divinely
happy and content. He saw clearly that his love
for her had been the great thing in his life, its crown
and its completion; that the thought of her as his
wife was worth being born for; that it made death
only a night full of stars with a promise of sunrise.
The story did not end with the ending of the soldier&#8217;s
life. The part before his death was no more
than a prelude. The real story was of the power of
love upon the spirit of a man after his passing, and
his wish that the adored woman left behind might
know the vital influence of a few hours&#8217; happiness
in shaping a soul to face eternity. The book was
supposed to be written in the first person, by the man,
and was in four parts. The first told of the courtship
and marrying; the second, of the man&#8217;s going
away from his wife-of-an-hour, to the front, and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>fall on the battlefield; the third described the regret
of the girl that she had not been able to give
more, and her resolve to atone by denying herself
love if it came to her in future; the fourth, the dead
soldier&#8217;s attempt to make her feel the truth; that she
was free of obligation because those few last hours
had been a gift of joy never to be taken from his
soul.</p>

<p>Denin had dashed down a title on the first page of
his manuscript before beginning the book. There
had seemed to him only one name for it: &#8220;The War
Wedding.&#8221; Now that he came to read it all over,
he still had the feeling that something in him more
powerful than himself had done the writing; and
suddenly he began to wish intensely that Barbara
might see the testament of his heart.</p>

<p>He wished this not because he was proud of his
work, or thought it superlatively good, but because
he hoped that it might comfort her. She had been
strangely reserved with him, invariably baffling, almost
mysterious, during the latter half of their acquaintance,
yet he had felt that he knew the truth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>of her nature, deep down under the girlish concealments.
He had believed her tender-hearted. If she
had not been so, why had she married him? And
he thought that a girl of her strong character and sensitive
spirit might be stabbed with remorse sometimes
after gathering the flower of happiness for
herself so near a new-made grave. He could not
bear to think that Barbara might torture her conscience
for his sake. He wanted her to be happy,
wanted it more than anything else now. Not that
he was naturally a marvel of unselfishness, but that
he loved Barbara Fay better than he had ever loved
himself. If this story which he had written&mdash;like,
yet unlike, her own story&mdash;should happen to fall into
Barbara&#8217;s hands, she might find consolation through
all the coming years, because of certain thoughts
from the man&#8217;s point of view, thoughts that would
almost surely be new to her. And what joy for
Denin, even lying in the gulf of forgetfulness, if his
hand could reach out from the shadows to give her
a thornless white rose of peace!</p>

<p>He wondered eagerly if he could find a publisher
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>in New York&mdash;a publisher who produced books in
England as well as America&mdash;to accept his manuscript.</p>

<p>Now that the wish was born, it seemed too good
to be true that anything could come of it. Still, he
determined to try, and try at once. Full of excitement
he went out into a noisy street, and bought
several newspapers and magazines. There were a
number of publishers&#8217; advertisements in them all,
some with familiar names, but one he had known
ever since he was old enough to read books. It was
a name of importance in the publishing world, but
there was no harm in aiming high. He had brought
the manuscript out with him, because he could not
bear to leave it alone in a strange house. Now he
decided to take the parcel to the publisher himself.
Nothing would have induced him to trust it to the
post.</p>

<p class='line center mt3 mb2'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>CHAPTER V</p>

<p>Four-thirty in the afternoon was Eversedge
Sibley&#8217;s hour for leaving his office. If
he had cared about escaping earlier he could easily
have got away, for since his father&#8217;s death he stood
at the head of the old publishing house; but to him
business was the romance, poetry, and adventure of
life. He passionately loved the champ and roar of
the printing-presses as many people love a Wagner
opera. There were never two days alike. Something
new was always happening. Yet just because
he was young for his &#8220;job,&#8221; and knew that he was a
man of moods and temperament, he forced himself
to be bound by certain rules. One of these rules
was, even if he chose to linger a few minutes after
four-thirty, that no caller need hope to be admitted.
That was a favorite regulation of Sibley&#8217;s. It made
him feel that, after all, he was very methodical.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>One afternoon, however, he did a worse thing than
break this rule. He went back from the elevator,
the whole length of the corridor to the outer office,
simply to enquire about a man he had met at the lift
door.</p>

<p>They almost collided as the man was stepping out
and as Sibley was about to step in. But he did not
step in. He let the lift shoot down without him,
while he paused to stare after the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange-looking customer!&#8221; he thought.</p>

<p>Sibley himself was a particularly immaculate person.
Being somewhat of the Latin type, black eyed
and olive skinned, he was shamefacedly afraid of
looking picturesque. He dressed, therefore, as precisely
as a fashion-plate. The man who had got out
of the lift might have bought his clothes at a junk-shop,
and a foreign junk-shop at that. They were not
clothes a gentleman could wear&mdash;yet Sibley received
a swift impression that a gentleman was wearing
them at that moment: a remarkably tall fellow, so
thin that his bones looked somehow too big for
him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>He walked past Sibley with no more than a glance,
yet it was partly the glance which impelled Sibley
to stop short and gaze at the back of a badly made
tweed coat, the worst sort of a &#8220;reach-me-down&#8221;
coat.</p>

<p>The quick mind of the publisher was addicted to
similes. (He had once written a book himself, under
a <i>nom de guerre</i>. It had failed.) The thought
sprang to his mind that the glance was like the sudden
opening of a dingy box, which let out a flash
of secret jewels.</p>

<p>In spite of his shocking clothes, the man had the
air and bearing of a soldier. Sibley noticed this, in
criticizing the straight back, and it aroused his curiosity
more than ever in connection with the scarred
face.</p>

<p>Any one who got out at the tenth floor of the
Sibley building must want to see Eversedge Sibley
or one of his partners, so evidently this person intended
to ask for some member of the firm. He
looked the last man on earth to be a budding author;
yet Eversedge Sibley had caught sight of a paper-wrapped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>roll of manuscript. One who was not of
the publishing or editorial world might have mistaken
it for something else; but no manuscript would disguise
itself from eyes so trained to fear and avoid
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks more like a heavy-weight champion invalided
after a desperate scrap, than a writer; or
like Samson betrayed by Delilah,&#8221; thought Sibley,
rather pleased with the fancy.</p>

<p>He put out his hand to touch the bell for the lift
to come up again, but did not touch it. Instead, he
turned and walked back along the marble-walled corridor
to the door of the reception room. The tall
man had just arrived and was talking to a wisp of
a creature facetiously known in the office as &#8220;the
chucker out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Sibley has gone, sir,&#8221; little McNutt was insisting,
with dignity. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t generally receive
strangers. Mr. Elliot is in, though, and might see
you if you could wait&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, McNutt caught sight of his &#8220;boss&#8221;
at the door, and by looking up a pair of thick gray
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>eyebrows, he made a distressful signal of warning.
It would be awkward for Mr. Sibley to be trapped
and buttonholed here, just as he had been officially
described as out. McNutt could not remember the
boss ever coming back after he had gone for the day,
and appearing in the publicity of the reception room.
If he had forgotten something, why didn&#8217;t he let
himself in at the door of his own private office, which
was only a little further along the hall? But, there
he was, and must be protected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Mr. Elliot?&#8221; enquired the stranger.</p>

<p>Eversedge Sibley spent a short holiday in England
every summer, and knew that the vilely
dressed man had the accent of the British upper
classes. His curiosity grew with what it fed on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Elliot is the third partner in the firm,&#8221; explained
McNutt, to whom such ignorance appeared
disgraceful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, I&#8217;d rather wait until to-morrow and
try to see Mr. Sibley himself,&#8221; said Denin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Mr. Sibley,&#8221; the publisher confessed, on
one of his irresistible impulses. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>back for something forgotten. I can give you a few
minutes if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s face lit. It could never have been anything
but plain, almost ugly, even before the scars
came; yet it was singularly arresting. &#8220;That&#8217;s very
good of you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Sibley ushered the odd visitor into his own private
office, but before he could even be invited to sit
down, Denin got to his errand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have thousands of manuscripts sent to
you,&#8221; he began, with a shyness which appealed to
Sibley. &#8220;I&mdash;suppose you hardly ever read one
yourself? You have men under you to do that.
But I felt I shouldn&#8217;t be satisfied unless I could
put the&mdash;the stuff I&#8217;ve written into your own hands.
Probably all amateurs feel like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Manuscripts which our readers pronounce on favorably
I always go through myself before accepting
them,&#8221; Sibley assured his visitor. &#8220;But of course,
there are a good many that&mdash;er&mdash;they don&#8217;t think
worth bothering me with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason for me to hope that mine will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>deserve a better fate,&#8221; Denin said. &#8220;All the same
it would&mdash;be a great thing for me if you should bring
it out&mdash;publish it on both sides of the water. It
isn&#8217;t as if I expected money for my work. I don&#8217;t.
I shouldn&#8217;t even <i>want</i> money. On the contrary&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Sibley cut him short with a warning. &#8220;We&#8217;re
not the sort of publishers who print books that authors
have to bribe us to put on the market. If a
book&#8217;s worth our while to publish, it&#8217;s worth our
while to pay for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denin laughed. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t going to suggest any
arrangement of that kind,&#8221; he apologized. &#8220;I&#8217;m
too poor for such a luxury. I&#8217;ve just come to New
York, third class, and I must &#8216;hustle&#8217; to make my
living. But I wrote this on shipboard, while I had
the time&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wrote a whole book on shipboard!&#8221; exclaimed
Sibley.</p>

<p>Denin was taken aback by the publisher&#8217;s surprise.
&#8220;Well, it was a slow boat&mdash;twelve days. And my
mind was full of this story. I had to write it. I
kept at it night and day. But for all I know there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>mayn&#8217;t be enough to make a book. That would be
a bit of a blow! I&#8217;m as ignorant as a child of such
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About how many thousand words does your
manuscript amount to?&#8221; Sibley asked, glancing at
the rather thin brown packet tied with a string.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the remotest idea!&#8221; Denin admitted.
&#8220;It didn&#8217;t occur to me to count words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; muttered the publisher. &#8220;You say it&#8217;s
a story&mdash;a novel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sort of a story,&#8221; its writer explained. &#8220;I
may as well mention&mdash;you&#8217;re sure to guess if you
glance over my work&mdash;that I&#8217;ve been fighting in
France. I was pretty badly knocked out&mdash;some
months ago. And you can see from the look of me
that I can&#8217;t be of use as a soldier while the war lasts,
if ever. Otherwise I shouldn&#8217;t be in New York
now. One doesn&#8217;t chuck fighting in these days unless
one&#8217;s unfit. While I was in hospital, I got to
thinking how a man might feel in certain circumstances&mdash;(not
like my own, of course; but one imagines
things)&mdash;and&mdash;well, the idea rather took hold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>of me. Here it is. I don&#8217;t expect you to read the
thing yourself. It&#8217;s not likely that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise you so much,&#8221; said Sibley, with suppressed
eagerness. &#8220;I <i>will</i> read it myself before
handing it over to any one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scarred face flushed; and again came that
sudden light as from a secret glitter of jewels. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t thank you enough!&#8221; Denin almost stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t thank me yet. That would be very premature!&#8221;
Sibley smiled generously; but even if he
had wished to do so, he couldn&#8217;t have patronized the
fellow. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t be too impatient. I&#8217;m a
busy man, you know. I&#8217;ll have a go at your manuscript
as soon as I can, but you mustn&#8217;t be disappointed
if you don&#8217;t hear for a week or ten days.
By the way, you&#8217;d better give me a card with your
name and address.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denin laughed again, a singularly pleasant laugh,
Sibley thought it. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t such a thing as a
card! My name is&mdash;John Sanbourne. And if I
may have a scrap of paper, I&#8217;ll write down my address.
I forgot to put it on the manuscript. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>mayn&#8217;t be at the same place when you&#8217;re ready to
decide. But I&#8217;ll tell them to forward the letter,
and then I&#8217;ll call on you. I&#8217;d rather do that than
let the story go through the post. I&#8217;ve got&mdash;fond
of it in a way&mdash;you see!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sibley did see. And the man being what he was,
the fondness struck the publisher as pathetic, like the
love of Picciola for his pale prison-flower. Reason
told Sibley that the ten or twelve days work of an
amateur (one who had lived to thirty or so, without
being moved to write) would turn out mere twaddle.
Yet instinct contradicted reason, as it often did with
Sibley. He had a strong presentiment that he
should find at least some remarkable points in the
work of this scarred soldier, whose square-jawed
face seemed to the secretly romantic mind of Sibley
a mask of hidden passions.</p>

<p>Only a few times since he became head of the
house had Eversedge Sibley consented to see a would-be
author whose fame was all to make. The few
he had received had been fascinating young women
of society with influence among his friends, famous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>beauties, or noted charmers; but he had never taken
so deep an interest in one of them as in the poverty-stricken,
steerage passenger. He went as far as the
reception room in showing his guest out; and then
instead of going down to his motor, which would
be waiting for him, let it wait. He returned to his
office, and looked again at the address which the author
had laid on his parcel of manuscript.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Sanbourne!&#8221; Eversedge Sibley said to himself,
aloud. The man&#8217;s face was as sincere as it was
plain, nevertheless Sibley was somehow sure that his
real name was not Sanbourne. He was sure that
the inner truth of the man, if it could but be known,
was a contradiction of the rough and strange outside;
and he wished so intensely to get at the hidden
inner side that he could not resist opening the parcel
there and then.</p>

<p>Never had Eversedge Sibley seen such a manuscript.
He was used to clearly typed pages of uniform
size, as easy to read as print. This was written
partly with pencil, partly with pen and ink, apparently
three or four different kinds of pens, each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>worse than the other. The paper, too, consisted of
odds and ends. The whole thing suggested poverty
and the meager condition of a steerage passenger.
But this squalor, which in most circumstances would
have caused Sibley to fling down the stuff in fastidious
disgust, sent a thrill through him. No ordinary
man with ordinary things to say could have had the
courage to struggle through such difficulties, to any
desired end. The longing to tell this story, whatever
it was, must have been strong in the man&#8217;s soul
as the urge of travail in the body of a woman.</p>

<p>In spite of the mean materials, the writing was
clear, and suggested&mdash;it seemed to the mood of Sibley&mdash;something
of the man&#8217;s strength and intense reserve.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;The War Wedding,&#8217;&#8221; he read at the top of the
first page. &#8220;Heavens, I hope it&#8217;s not going to be in
blank verse!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not in blank verse. He had to read only
the first lines to assure himself of that.</p>

<p>The story began with the description of a garden.
It was simply done, but it painted a picture, and&mdash;praise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>be to the powers, there were no split infinitives
nor gush of adjectives! Eversedge Sibley saw the
garden. He was the man who walked in it, and met
the girl who came down the stone steps between the
blue borders of lavender. The story became his
story. For an hour he forgot his office, his waiting
chauffeur, and everything else that belonged to him.</p>

<p>So he might have gone on forgetting, if Stephen
Eversedge, his junior partner and cousin, had not
peeped anxiously in at the door. &#8220;They said you&#8217;d
gone away and then come back. I thought I&#8217;d just
ask if anything was the matter,&#8221; he excused himself
to the master mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;The matter is, we&#8217;ve got hold of the most wonderful
human document&mdash;good God, yes, and <i>soul</i>
document!&mdash;that any house in this country or any
other has ever published!&#8221; The words burst out
from Sibley like bullets from a <i>mitrailleuse</i>.</p>

<p class='line center mt3 mb2'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>CHAPTER VI</p>

<p>Denin hardly knew what to think of the telegram
which came next morning. It asked
him to call at once on Mr. Sibley; but Denin, warned
that the manuscript story could not be read for a
week or more, did not dream that the publisher had
already raced through it. His fear was that a mere
glance at the first page had been enough, showing the
skilled critic that the work lacked literary value; or
else that the bulk was insufficient to make a book.
Mr. Sibley might, in kindness, wish to end the author&#8217;s
suspense, and put him out of misery.</p>

<p>When the message arrived, Denin was reading
and marking newspaper advertisements. He meant
to go without delay to several places of business
that offered more or less suitable work; but he was
ready to risk missing any chance, no matter how
good, when the fate of his ewe lamb was at stake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>He was too despondent at the thought of its rejection
to plan placing it elsewhere, but he could not
bear to lose time in reclaiming it.</p>

<p>He felt, as he was led once more into Sibley&#8217;s
private office, as if he had to face a painful operation
without anesthetics, so sensitive had he come to
be on the subject of his story&mdash;the manuscript of his
heart, written in the blood of his sacrifice. There
lay the familiar pages on the desk, all ready, he did
not doubt, to be wrapped up and handed back to him.
He had so schooled himself to a refusal that the publisher&#8217;s
first words made his head swim. He could
not believe that he heard aright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Sanbourne, I congratulate you!&#8221; Sibley
said, getting up from his desk-chair and holding
out a cordial hand. &#8220;We congratulate ourselves
on the chance of publishing your book.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denin took the hand held out and moved it up
and down mechanically, but did not speak. Following
the publisher&#8217;s extreme graciousness his silence
might have seemed boorish, but Sibley knew
how to interpret it. He realized that the other was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>struck dumb, and he felt a thrill of romantic delight
in the situation, in his own august power
to confer benefits. He was not conducting himself
as a business man in this case, but he knew
by sureness of instinct that the strange amateur
would take no mean advantage of his confessed
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;We think,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;that you have written
something very original and very beautiful. Without
being sentimental, it&#8217;s full of that kind of indescribable
sentiment which goes straight to the
heart. It will be a short book, only about fifty thousand
words, or even less; but that doesn&#8217;t matter,
because a word added or a word left out would make
a false note. The thing&#8217;s an inspiration. You&#8217;ve
got a big success before you. You ought to be a
happy man, Mr. Sanbourne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make me feel as if I were in a dream,&#8221; said
Denin.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way your story has made <i>me</i> feel,&#8221;
said Sibley. &#8220;Really, your method has an extraordinary
effect. Talking of dreams, it&#8217;s almost as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>if you&#8217;d written the whole story in some strange,
inspired dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I did write it so,&#8221; Denin said, more as
if he spoke to himself than to another. &#8220;I had no
method&mdash;consciously. The story just came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One feels that, and it&#8217;s the most compelling part
of its charm,&#8221; said Sibley. &#8220;Well, now I&#8217;ve paid
you your due of appreciation. Sit down, and let us
talk business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Business?&#8221; Denin echoed, rather stupidly. But
he accepted the chair his host offered, and Sibley too
sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, business,&#8221; the publisher cheerily repeated.
&#8220;We should like to rush the book out as soon as possible.
It&#8217;s too late to have it set up and given to
our spring travelers to take round and show to the
trade&mdash;which is one of the most valuable ways of
advertising, I assure you. But in an immense country
like America that means months of traveling before
a book appears. Yours has a specially poignant
interest at the moment, and I have so much faith in
its power that I believe it can advertise itself. Of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>course I don&#8217;t mean that we won&#8217;t give it big publicity
in the newspapers. We shall spread ourselves
in that way, and spend a lot of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And can you get the book out soon in England,
too?&#8221; asked Denin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. We&#8217;ll produce here and there simultaneously,
and do it in a record rush, if you can
promise to stay on the spot and read proofs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do whatever you wish,&#8221; said Denin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now about the question of money,&#8221; Sibley went
on, exquisitely and literally &#8220;enjoying himself.&#8221;
&#8220;Some people call me hard as nails, a regular skinflint.
And so I am, with those who try to squeeze
me. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll have any such complaint
to make. Your name is unknown, but I believe in
your book and I want to be generous with you.
What do you say to an advance payment of three
thousand dollars, with fifteen per cent. royalty for
the first ten thousand sales, and twenty per cent.
after that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; stammered Denin, astounded. &#8220;I told
you yesterday I didn&#8217;t want payment. That was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>true, what I said then. It would seem a kind of sacrilege
to take money for such a book&mdash;a book I
wrote because I wanted to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that at all,&#8221; Sibley cut in dryly.
&#8220;You are the first author I&mdash;or any other publisher,
I should think&mdash;ever had to urge to accept hard
cash. But you&#8217;re probably an exception to a good
many rules! We can&#8217;t take your book as a present,
you know! So if you want it published you&#8217;ll have
to come round to our terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that?&#8221; asked Denin. &#8220;You won&#8217;t
bring out my story if I refuse your money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do mean that, though I should hate to sacrifice
the book. And I honestly believe that many
people would be happier for reading it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; Denin answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll accept
the money and thank you for it. I want my
book to come out, more than I want anything else&mdash;that&mdash;that
can possibly happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>To a man who had lived from hand to mouth as
John Sanbourne had since Sir John Denin died, three
thousand dollars seemed something like a fortune.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>He had lost his old sense of proportion in life, and
had almost forgotten how it felt to have all the
money he wanted. Perhaps he forgot more easily
than most men of his class, for he had never cared
greatly for the things which money alone can buy.
His tastes had always seemed to his friends ridiculously
simple, so simple as to be dangerously near
affectation; and as a small boy he had announced
firmly that he would &#8220;rather be a gardener in a beautiful
garden, than one of those millionaires who have
to do their business always in towns.&#8221; Now, when
he had recovered from the first shock of accepting
money for the book of his heart, he began to reflect
how to plan his life. The thought that he could
have a garden was a real incentive, for working in
a garden would save him from the unending desolation
of uselessness, when the last proofs were corrected
and there was no longer any work to do on his
story.</p>

<p>Barbara and Mrs. Fay had both talked to John
Denin about their old home in California, and with
the knowledge that he could afford it a keen wish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>was suddenly born in John Sanbourne to make some
kind of a home for himself in the country where
Barbara had lived. She was named, her mother
had told him, after Santa Barbara. The girl had
been born near Santa Barbara, and had grown up
there to the age of thirteen, when her father had
died and their place had been sold. After that, the
mother and daughter had gone to Paris. Denin recalled
with crystal clearness all the girl&#8217;s warm,
eager picturing of her old home, for he remembered
scenery and even descriptions of scenery with greater
distinctness than he remembered faces. He had
often thought (until he met Barbara, and fell in
love) that he cared more for nature and places and
things than he could ever care for people, except
those of his very own flesh and blood. He knew differently
now, but it seemed to him that he would be
nearer finding peace in Barbara&#8217;s home-country than
anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>There was no danger that she or her mother might
some day appear and meet him face to face, to the
ruin of Barbara&#8217;s dream of happiness with Trevor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>d&#8217;Arcy. Mother and daughter had said that they
never wished to go back, now that the old ties were
broken. When occasionally they returned to America,
they spent their time in Washington and New
York; but with Barbara married to Trevor d&#8217;Arcy,
and mistress in her own right of Gorston Old Hall,
all interests would combine to keep mother and
daughter in England. John Denin&#8217;s ghost might,
if it chose, safely haunt the birthplace of his lost
love.</p>

<p>The day that the last proof-sheet of &#8220;The War
Wedding&#8221; was corrected, Sanbourne said good-by to
Eversedge Sibley and started for California. He
could not afford to travel by the Limited or any of
the fast trains, so there were many changes and
waits for him, and he was nearly a week on the way;
but when a man has lost or thrown over the best
things in his life there is the consolation that none
of its small hardships seem to matter. Besides, he
had Santa Barbara to look forward to; and Denin
told himself that, things being as they were, he was
lucky to have anything to look forward to at all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>When he reached the end of the journey at last it
was almost like coming to a place he had known in
dreams, so clearly did he recognize the mountains
whose lovely shapes crowded towards the sea. Barbara
had all their names by heart and treasured their
photographs. He remembered her stories of the
islands, too, floating on the horizon like boats at
anchor; and the trails of golden kelp seen through
the green transparence of the waves, like the hair
of sleeping mermaids. In the same way he knew the
big hotel with its mile-long drive bordered with flaming
geraniums; he knew the old town and&mdash;without
asking&mdash;how to go from there to the Mission. Also
he knew that, on the way to the Mission, he would
find the place which Barbara had cared for most
until she fell in love&mdash;not with him&mdash;but with Gorston
Old Hall.</p>

<p>He limped perceptibly still, and could not walk
far without pain, so he decided to be extravagant
for the first time since &#8220;coming into his money&#8221; and
hire a small, cheap motor-car. It was driven by its
small, cheap owner, a young man with a ferocious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>fund of information about Santa Barbara, and every
one who had ever lived there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heard of the Fay place?&#8221; he echoed Denin&#8217;s
first question. &#8220;Well, I should smile! Why, me
and Barbie Fay are about the same age,&#8221; he plunged
on, so violently that no interruption could have
stopped him. &#8220;Not that we were in the same <i>set</i>.
Not much! But a cat can look at a king. And any
boy can look at any girl, I guess. Gee! That little
girl was some <i>worth</i> lookin&#8217; at! Her mother
thought she was too good for us plain Americans, so
she took her off to Europe and clapped her in a convent,
after the old man died. They&#8217;ve never been
back this way since, nor won&#8217;t be now. The girl&#8217;s
been married twice, I was readin&#8217; in the papers.
Once to some English lord or other who left her the
same day, and got himself killed in France; and the
second time, just a few weeks ago, to a cousin on her
mother&#8217;s side&mdash;a Britisher, too. There was an interview
with the mother in the <i>San Francisco Call</i>,
I saw. One of our California journalists over there
in the war-zone got it&mdash;quite a good scoop. Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>Fay said it was an old romance between Barbie and
this Captain-What&#8217;s-his-name. But we never seen
him here. I guess he&#8217;s English, root and branch.
Good thing for that &#8216;old romance&#8217; they could make
sure the other chap was killed all right, all right,
wasn&#8217;t it? Some of them poor fellows gets blown
to bits so you can&#8217;t tell one from t&#8217; other, they say.
But the girl&#8217;s mother mentioned to our <i>Call</i> reporter,
that they knew the husband&#8217;s body by a stylograph
pen in a gold case, which was her own last present
to him. If it hadn&#8217;t been for that little thing,
found in a rag or two left of the feller&#8217;s coat, Barbie
wouldn&#8217;t have dast married again, I bet. Say,
that&#8217;s one of them anecdotes they put under the
heading of &#8216;Too Strange not to be True!&#8217; ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is strange,&#8221; Denin repeated mechanically.
It was strange, too&mdash;above all strange&mdash;that he
should have had to come to Barbara&#8217;s birthplace to
learn this detail casually. A thousand times he had
wondered how they had identified John Denin&#8217;s
body with enough certainty to take it back to England
and give it a funeral with military honors.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>Perhaps, if he had not come to Santa Barbara and
in Santa Barbara happened to stumble upon this
loquacious fellow with the motor-car to hire, he
might have gone through all the rest of his life without
knowing. And another strange thing was that
he had lent the stylographic pen&mdash;Mrs. Fay&#8217;s last
present&mdash;to a man who wanted to write a letter just
before the battle. That man, who had been killed,
was possibly still reported &#8220;missing,&#8221; while John
Denin&#8217;s wife, assured of his death by a peculiarly intimate
clue, had been able to take her happiness without
fear. If Barbara&#8217;s mother had not given him
the pen, he would not now be numbered among the
dead, but would have been free to go back to his
wife of an hour, and perhaps even teach her to love
him in the end.</p>

<p>Well, all that didn&#8217;t bear thinking of now! He
tried, as he had tried a hundred times&mdash;but never so
poignantly&mdash;to hold in his heart the memory of flaming
happiness worth all the pain of living through
the burnt-out years: the happiness he had put into
the pages of his &#8220;War Wedding.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>With some people who had known Barbara he
would have liked to talk of her, but not with this
crude youth who spouted her praises from a mouth
full of chewing gum. Denin answered a pointed
question of the chauffeur&#8217;s by saying that he had enquired
about the Fay place because he heard it was
worth seeing. He might like to buy a little property
somewhere near if it could be got.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet it can be got!&#8221; was the prompt answer.
&#8220;That is, if you want something little
<i>enough</i>, you can get a bit of the old Fay property
itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; said Denin. &#8220;I thought it was all disposed
of years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it was. Eight years ago and a bit. I remember
because I made an errand to sneak down to the
depot and see Barbie go off in the train, as pretty as
a white rose, dressed in black for her pa. I was only
a cub of fourteen. An old feller from the East,
staying at the Potter, went crazy about the place
and bought it at Mrs. Fay&#8217;s own price. (Lucky for
her! They say she&#8217;d nothing else to live on!)
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>Feller by the name of Samuel Drake. He was out in
California for his bronchitis or something, and took
a fancy to the country. He wanted his married son
with a young bride to live with him, so he got a
real bright idea. I suppose the folks who told you
about the Fay place never said nothing about a kind
of little playhouse called the Mirador (Spanish for
view-place or look-out, I guess), built at one end of
the property that fronts to the sea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;rather think they did mention something of
the kind,&#8221; said Denin. The first time he had ever
seen Barbara, at a dance soon after she was presented,
she had happened to speak of the Mirador.
It was a miniature house which her father had built
for her at her favorite view point, as a birthday surprise,
when she was ten. There was an &#8220;upstairs
and a downstairs,&#8221; a bath, and a &#8220;tiny, tiny kitchen&#8221;
where she had been supposed to do her own cooking.
In the sitting-room she had had lessons with her governess.
The one upstairs room, with its wonderful
view of the bay and the islands, had been turned
into a bedroom for her, when she had scarlet fever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>and had to be isolated with a nurse. She had
&#8220;loved getting well there, and lying in her hammock
on the balcony with curtains of roses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old man Drake had the smart notion of putting
on a couple more rooms in a wing at the back, and
offering it to his son and his son&#8217;s bride,&#8221; the driver
of the car was explaining, over the motor&#8217;s cheap clatter.
&#8220;But while the work was going on, the new
beams caught fire one night (I guess some tramp
could tell why) and the whole addition and a bit
of the original burnt down. Just then the son
changed his plans anyhow, and decided to go into
business with his wife&#8217;s folks in the East. That
sort of sickened the old man, so he let the Mirador
fall into rack and ruin; and now he spends about
three quarters of his time in Boston with the son. I
guess he&#8217;s sorry he was in such a hurry to buy the
Fay place. Anyways, he won&#8217;t spend money on
the Mirador, but rather than it should stay the way
it is, he&#8217;ll sell it in its present condition with enough
ground to make a garden. The thing looks like a
burnt bird&#8217;s nest&mdash;except for the flowers, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>house ain&#8217;t much bigger than a baby doll&#8217;s house. I
suppose it wouldn&#8217;t suit you, would it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it might,&#8221; answered Denin, trying to
speak calmly. But in his heart he meant to have
Barbara&#8217;s Mirador if it cost him every penny he had
left from his advance on &#8220;The War Wedding.&#8221; It
was almost as if, to atone for taking herself out of
his life, Barbara had given him this dear plaything
of her childhood to remember her by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll be able to make up your mind,&#8221;
said his guide, slowing down the rattletrap car.
&#8220;Here we are at the Fay place, now&mdash;or the Drake
place, as maybe I ought to call it&mdash;and there&#8217;s the
Mirador. No wonder old Drake wants to get it
fixed up again! The way it is now, it spoils the look
of the whole property.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;Fay place&#8221; gave a first impression of having
been an orange plantation transformed into a vast
garden. There were acres and acres of land, Denin
could not guess how many. In the midst of orange
trees in fruit and blossom, and pepper trees shedding
coral, and tall palm trees with long gray beards
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>which were last year&#8217;s fronds, stood the big, rambling
pink bungalow that had been Barbara&#8217;s home. Its
tiled roof and wide loggias were just visible from the
road; but the Mirador, to which the driver pointed,
was in plain sight. Denin&#8217;s heart bounded. He almost
expected to see a young girl with smoke-blue
eyes and copper-beech hair (it had been red in those
days, she&#8217;d told him) open one of the shuttered windows
and look out with a smile.</p>

<p>Once, while she and her mother were staying at
Gorston Old Hall, he had tried to teach Barbara
chess. In the midst of a game which she hoped to
win, she suddenly saw herself facing defeat. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
begin again, and play it all over!&#8221; she had cried out,
laughing.</p>

<p>Ah, if they could do that now: begin again, and
play the game all over!</p>

<p>Well, the ghost of John Denin could begin to
play hero with the ghost of Barbara Fay&#8217;s childhood,
when he came to have his home in her old playhouse.
He knew that this must and should be his
home, now that he had come and seen the place and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>felt its influence even more subtly than he had
thought to feel it. He could not get through his
shorn life anywhere else.</p>

<p>The Mirador was distant at least four acres from
the house. It too was pink, like the parent bungalow,
or it had once been pink, before the fire which
destroyed the addition for servants at the back had
marred the rose color of its plastered adobe walls.
A roof of Spanish tiles dropped low like a visor, giving
cover to the balcony of the upper story; and
the floor of that balcony roofed the one below. On
each of these balconies only one window&mdash;which was
also a door&mdash;looked out; but it was a huge window,
with green exterior shutters; and the stout, square
columns of the two verandas were almost hidden
with roses, passion-flower, and convolvulus which had
either survived the fire or grown up since. Though
the front was so nearly intact, from each side of the
little house could be seen the blackened wreck of
burnt beams; and to screen the parent bungalow from
any possible glimpse of this eyesore, a high barrier
of trellis-work had been erected about two hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>feet distant from the Mirador. Over this barrier
some quick-climbing creepers had been trained, and
they had grown in such thick masses that an almost
impenetrable green wall had already grown up between
the big house and the tiny one.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will suit me exactly,&#8221; said Denin, trying to
speak coolly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll drive back at once, please,
to the agent who has the selling of the Mirador.&#8221;</p>

<p class='dots'>&nbsp;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

<p>He was almost afraid to hear the price, lest his
last dollar might not suffice to secure the treasure.
But the agent in whose hands &#8220;old Drake&#8221; had put
his business named the sum of two thousand dollars.
This, he said, was a mere song for land so
near Santa Barbara; and, no doubt, he was right.
But it was a large slice of John Sanbourne&#8217;s capital,
and left him only a small remnant for repairing the
place, as he must agree to do before the contract
could be signed.</p>

<p>The journey from New York had cost a good deal,
and&mdash;he must live somehow, unless he could get
work fitted for a &#8220;lame dog&#8221; to do. Mr. Sibley had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>talked vaguely of &#8220;royalties,&#8221; but it seemed impossible
to Denin that many people should actually
care to <i>buy</i> his book&mdash;the strange little book written
for himself, and sent wandering out into the world
to find Barbara. Even if people did buy it, the sales
could surely never go beyond the three thousand dollars
Eversedge Sibley had recklessly pressed upon
him in advance! However, Denin did not hesitate
for any of these reasons. &#8220;I&#8217;ll buy the Mirador and
the acre and a half of ground Mr. Drake is willing
to sell with it,&#8221; he said to the agent. &#8220;And I&#8217;d like
to pay for it if possible and settle up everything to-day.
Then I could move into the house at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The agent stared. &#8220;There&#8217;s no furniture,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can get in enough to begin with, in an hour or
two, surely,&#8221; Denin persisted. &#8220;I&#8217;m used to roughing
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other could well believe that, from the look
of the queer fellow! As a business man, he would
certainly not accept a check, and would be inclined
to ask expert opinion even on bank notes, paid by an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>unknown client with such scars, and such clothes, and
in such a hurry!</p>

<p>&#8220;You could hardly live in the house while the repairs
you must agree to are being made,&#8221; the agent
reminded the would-be buyer. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think
you had better&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can manage all right,&#8221; Denin cut short the advice.
&#8220;As for the repairs, I shall make them of
course. What Mr. Drake asks is for the house to be
restored to its former appearance (aren&#8217;t those the
words?) not enlarged. Well, I must tell you
frankly that I can&#8217;t afford to pay for labor. I will
guarantee to make the Mirador look just as it used
to look, and do it all with my own hands. I can&#8217;t
work very fast, because&mdash;you can see, I&#8217;ve been disabled.
But I shall have an incentive to finish as
soon as possible, if I&#8217;m actually living in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had a severe accident, I suppose?&#8221; the curious
agent could not resist suggesting.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was&mdash;in a way&mdash;an accident,&#8221; said Denin,
and his smile was rather grim.</p>

<p>When he had paid for the place, had bought materials
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>for restoring the house and improving the
garden, had collected a few bits of furniture and
added some other necessaries, the owner of the Mirador
had only seven hundred dollars left out of his fortune.
Nor did he at that time know how he was to
earn more dollars. Nevertheless he had come as
near to be being content as he could ever hope to be in
this world. He had given his own old home to
Barbara, and there was no place for memories of him
there. But she had given her old home to him (unconsciously,
it was true; yet it seemed to be her gift)
and memories of Barbara would be his companions
each hour of the day. Besides, he had the task of
restoring every marred feature of the little Mirador
exactly as she had described it to him. He bought
a ladder and plaster and paint, and did mason&#8217;s
work and painter&#8217;s work with a good will. In the
four rooms which were more or less intact&mdash;bedroom,
sitting-room, miniature kitchen and bath&mdash;he put a
few odds and ends of second-hand furniture, enough
for a hermit. And when his labor of love on the
house was accomplished, he set to work in the garden.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>Some day, he told himself, he should find in
the garden the greatest solace of all.</p>

<p>In his deep absorption, he forgot the book for
days on end. Even in his dreams he did not remember
it, for in the room where Barbara had lain ill
with scarlet fever, dreams lent her to him, a childish
Barbara, very kind and sweet. He knew the date
on which the book was to come out, but he had lost
count by a day or two, therefore it was a shock of
surprise to open a parcel which arrived one morning
by post, and to see six purple volumes. On each
cover, in gold lettering, was printed &#8220;The War Wedding:
John Sanbourne.&#8221;</p>

<p>His hand shook a little as he opened the front
page, and began to read. Strange, how poignantly
real the story was in this form, more real even than
when he had written it, or read it over in manuscript
that first day in New York many weeks ago
now. He went on and on, and could not stop.
There was no servant in the Mirador to look after
his wants, and so he had no food till evening; none
until he had finished the book, and had walked for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>a long time in the garden, thinking it all over with
passionate revival of interest. After that night the
book again shared his dreams with Barbara. Sometimes
in dreaming, he saw Barbara reading the story;
but when he waked, he said to himself there were ten
chances against one that she would ever hear of it.</p>

<p>When &#8220;The War Wedding&#8221; in volume form was
about a fortnight or three weeks old, a thick envelope
full of American press cuttings arrived for &#8220;Mr.
John Sanbourne,&#8221; from Eversedge Sibley and Company.
Every critic, even those of the most important
newspapers; praised the work of the unknown
author with enthusiasm. A notice signed by a
famous name said, &#8220;In reading this story, told with
a limpid simplicity almost unique in the annals of
story-writing, one forgets the printed page and feels
that one is listening to a voice: not an ordinary voice,
but the voice of a disembodied soul which has forgotten
nothing of this existence and has already
learned much about the next: a philosopher of crystal
clearness and inspiring serenity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nearly all the criticisms had something in them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>of the same curious exaltation of mood. The writers
asked: &#8220;Who is John Sanbourne, that he can work
this spell upon us?&#8221; And one said, &#8220;Whoever he is, he
is bound to get post-bags full of &#8216;appreciations&#8217; from
half the women in the world, and a good many men.&#8221;</p>

<p>A letter from Sibley was enclosed with the cuttings,
congratulating the author. &#8220;This is only the
first batch,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;but it&#8217;s a phenomenally big
one for this short time. Evidently these hardened
critics shared my weakness. When they began the
book they couldn&#8217;t put it down till the end, and
then they had to relieve their pent-up feelings by
dashing them onto paper at white heat. Many of
these reviews, as you&#8217;ll see by the date, appeared on
the day after publication, most of the others on that
following. Such opinions by such critics in such
papers have sold the book like hot cakes. Luckily
we expected a huge demand, or we should already be
unable to supply it. Thanks to our foresight we
have a second and third big edition ready, and an
immense fourth one in the press. We have heard
by cable that our history over here is repeating itself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>in England. The exact wording is, &#8216;Reviews
and orders unprecedented.&#8217; You will be getting offers
from all the publishers for your next work, but
we hope you&#8217;ll be true to us. I am in earnest when
I speak of this, for if I am interviewed, I should like
to be able to say, &#8216;Mr. Sanbourne has already an idea
for another book which we hope to publish about a
year from now.&#8217; That will keep them remembering
you! Not that they&#8217;re likely to forget for awhile.
They&#8217;ll be too busy crying&mdash;the women, I mean, and
I shouldn&#8217;t consider a man safe without his handkerchief.
Please wire about the new book. Also
whether we are at liberty to answer the numerous
journalistic questions we&#8217;re getting about you, with
any personal details, or whether you prefer to hide
behind a veil of mystery. I&#8217;m not sure myself
which is preferable.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Sanbourne was very sure. He left his garden
work to walk to Santa Barbara and send a telegram.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say nothing about me to any one, please, except
that I shall never write another book.&#8221;</p>

<p class='line center mt3 mb2'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>CHAPTER VII</p>

<p>John Sanbourne had smiled when he read
the critic&#8217;s prophecy that he was &#8220;bound to get
letters of appreciation from half the women in the
world,&#8221; and he had thought no more of the comic
suggestion until the letters began to come. But the
letters were not comic.</p>

<p>They were forwarded in large packets by Sibley
and Company, and there were many, incredibly
many of them; some from men, but mostly from
women. The writers felt impelled to tell the author
of &#8220;The War Wedding&#8221; what a wonderful
book they thought it was, or how much good it had
done them in their different states of mind. These
states the readers of Sanbourne&#8217;s book described almost
as penitents confessing to a priest detail their
sins. And the strange confidences, or pitiful pleadings
for advice and help from one who &#8220;seemed to
know such glorious truths about life and death,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>were desperately pathetic to Denin. He was utterly
amazed and overwhelmed by this phase of his
unlooked-for success, and knew not how to cope with
it.</p>

<p>The first thousand and more letters were all from
people in the United States. Then letters from
Canada began drifting in. At last, when &#8220;The War
Wedding&#8221; had been on sale and selling edition after
edition for eight weeks, a rather smaller parcel than
usual arrived from the publishers. Denin, who was
in the garden, took it from the postman, at the new
gate which led to the Mirador. It was in the morning,
and he had been gathering late roses; for every
day he decorated with her favorite blossoms the two
principal rooms of the house which child-Barbara
had loved. He had a big pair of scissors in his
hand; and sitting down on a bench, in the cool strip
of shade that ran the length of the lower balcony,
he cut the string which fastened the packet. This
he did, not because he was impatient to see what it
contained, but because he was warm and tired after
two hours of garden work and wanted an excuse to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>rest. The letters of so many sad women who begged
for counsel that he knew not how to give, were having
a shattering effect upon his nerves. He had not
supposed that there were so many tragic souls of
women in the world, outside the war-zone, and he
dreaded the details of their lives. Sometimes he was
half tempted to put the letters away or destroy them,
unread.</p>

<p>There was a vague hope in his mind that this
parcel might have something other than letters in
it: but as the shears bit the tightly tied string, the
stout linen envelope burst open and began to disgorge
its contents: letters&mdash;letters&mdash;letters!</p>

<p>Between his feet John Sanbourne had placed the
basket of roses; and the letters, falling out of the
big envelope, began to drop onto the green leaves
and crêpy-crisp blooms of pink and white and
cream.</p>

<p>&#8220;English stamps!&#8221; he said aloud&mdash;for the habit
had grown upon him of talking to himself. Bending
down to pick up the letters, a dark flush streamed
to his forehead. There was one envelope of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>same texture, the same gray-blue tint, and the same
long, narrow shape that Sir John Denin had liked
and always used at Gorston Old Hall. It had fallen
face downward; and as he rescued it from a fragrant
bath of dew, he slowly turned it over. There
was an English stamp upon this envelope also, and
it was addressed to &#8220;John Sanbourne, Esq., care of
Messrs. Eversedge Sibley and Company,&#8221; in Barbara&#8217;s
handwriting.</p>

<p>For an instant everything went black, just as it
had done months ago when he had got on his feet
too suddenly in hospital. He shut his eyes, and
leaned back with his head against the house wall&mdash;the
wall of Barbara&#8217;s Mirador. It was as if he
could hear her voice speaking to him across six thousand
miles of land and sea. But it spoke to John
Sanbourne, not to John Denin.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God&mdash;she&#8217;s read the book. <i>She&#8217;s written!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>He had to say the words over to himself before
he could make the thing seem credible.</p>

<p>And even then he did not open the letter. He
dreaded to open it, and sat very still and rigid, grasping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>the envelope as if it were an electric battery of
which he could not let go.</p>

<p>What if she hated the book? What if she wrote,
as a woman who had been twice a war bride, to say
that a subject such as he had chosen was too sacred
to put into print? What if she felt bound to reproach
the author for treading brutally on holy
ground?</p>

<p>If that was what the letter had to say to him,
his message of peace had failed, and all his patched-up
scheme of existence broke down in that one failure.</p>

<p>The thought that he was a coward shrinking from
a blow nerved him to open the letter. He was on
the point of tearing the envelope, but he could not
be rough with a thing Barbara had touched, nor could
he deface it. He took up the scissors and cut off one
end of the envelope, then drew out a sheet of the
familiar gray-blue paper. Unfolding it, his hands
trembled. All the rest of his life, such as it was, he
felt, hung on what he was about to read.</p>

<p>The letter began abruptly. &#8220;You must have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>many letters from strangers, but none will bring you
more gratitude than this. If you are like your book,
you are too generous to be bored by grateful words
from people whose sore hearts you helped to heal, so
I won&#8217;t apologize. You could not write as you do,
I think, if you didn&#8217;t want to do good to others.
Will you then help me, even more than you have
helped me already, by answering a question I am
going to ask? Will you tell me whether the wonderful
things you say, to comfort those of us who
are losing our dearest in battle, are just inspired
<i>thoughts</i>, or whether you have yourself been very
near death, so near that you caught a vision from
the other side? If you answer me, and if you say
that actual experience gave you this knowledge, your
book&mdash;which has already been like a strong hand
dragging me up from the depths&mdash;will become a
beautiful message meant especially for me out of
all the whole world, making all my future life
bearable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every night for months I&#8217;ve gone to bed unable
to sleep, because I&#8217;ve felt exactly as if my brain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>were a battlefield, full of the agony and hopelessness
of brave men dying violent and dreadful deaths,
cut off in the midst of youth, with the stories of their
lives tragically unfinished. But since I read in your
book that marvelous scene with those suddenly released
spirits&mdash;young men of both sides, friends and
enemies, meeting and talking to each other, saying,
&#8216;Is this all?&#8217; &#8216;Is this the worst that death can do to
us?&#8217; why, I seem to pass beyond the battlefield! I
go with those happy, surprised young men who are
seeing for the first time the great &#8216;reality behind the
thing&#8217; and a feeling of rest and immense peace comes
to me. I don&#8217;t keep it long at a time. I can&#8217;t, yet.
But if you write and say you <i>know</i>, I think I may
some day learn to keep it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the English edition of your book, but I
have read in a newspaper an extract from the interview
a journalist had with the publisher in New
York. You see, everybody who has some one dear
in the war, or has lost some one beloved, is reading
and talking of the book. They all want to know
things about you, but perhaps not all for as <i>real</i> a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>reason as mine. Some people have said that perhaps
the author may be a woman, who chooses to write
under a man&#8217;s name. I felt sure from the first it
couldn&#8217;t be so, for only a man could say those things
as you say them; but I was glad of your publisher&#8217;s
assurance that you are a man, and that your home
now is in the far West in America. Perhaps I
shouldn&#8217;t have dared write you if you were in this
country, because&mdash;but no, I needn&#8217;t explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name can be of no interest to you, yet I will
sign it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours gratefully, Barbara Denin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barbara Denin.&#8221; ... <i>She had kept his name!</i></p>

<p>Many a woman did (he was aware) after a second
marriage continue to use the name of her first husband,
in order to retain a title. But all he knew of
the girl Barbara Fay made it amazing to him that
she should hold to the name of a man she had never
loved, after becoming the wife of a man she had
loved since childhood.</p>

<p>A wild doubt set his brain on fire. Could there
have been some terrible misunderstanding? Was it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>possible that after all she had never married Trevor
d&#8217;Arcy? ... Carried away on the flame of passion
fanned by her letter, Denin told himself that it
might be so, and that if she were free he would still
have the right to go back to her. If she had not
given herself to another man she belonged to him,
to him alone, and she would not hate him if he explained
the sacrifice he had made for her sake.</p>

<p>He was on his feet before he knew what he was
doing. The blinding hope lit body and soul as with
some curative ray beyond the ultra violet. It shot,
through his worn frame, life and abounding health,
making of him for a magical moment more than the
man he had been a year ago. But it was only a
moment; indeed, less than a moment. For it did
not take him sixty seconds to remember <i>how</i> he had
heard of Barbara&#8217;s marriage to her cousin Captain
d&#8217;Arcy. Walter Severne the airman had said that
her wedding had taken place on the same day with
his own. Severne had blamed her. Every word he
had said was branded on Denin&#8217;s brain. There
could be no mistake. Whatever the motive might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>be for signing herself Barbara Denin, she was in all
certainty d&#8217;Arcy&#8217;s wife.</p>

<p>With the violent reaction of feeling came a sense
of physical disintegration. A heavy fatigue that
weighted his heart and turned his bones to iron followed
the brief buoyancy of spirit. Yet he could
not rest. He had to walk, to keep in constant movement,
to escape some tidal wave which threatened
suddenly to engulf his soul. He passed out from
the cool shadow of the balcony into the blaze of
sunlight and drank in the hot perfume of the flowers.
At the end of a path a tall cypress held its
black, burnt-out torch high against the sky. Denin
went and leaned against it; doubly glad of his loneliness
in this refuge he had found, and thankful
that none but the trees and flowers of his garden
could see him in his weakness and his pain.</p>

<p>The dark cypress he looked up to seemed to have
gone through fire and to have triumphed over death.
Denin felt a kind of kinship with it, wishing that
from the tree and from all nature calmness and
strength might pass into his spirit. He imagined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>that he could hear the rushing of sap deep under the
rough bark. Generations of joys and sorrows had
come and gone since the tree was young, and had
vanished, leaving no more trace than sun or storm.
So it would be with what he was suffering now.
The things that mattered in the life of this earth
were strength and steadfastness. Denin prayed for
them, a voiceless prayer to Nature.</p>

<p>When he grew calmer he walked again, and lifted
up his face to the sun. &#8220;I&#8217;ll answer her letter,&#8221;
he thought. It seemed strange to him now, after the
shock of what had happened, that when the letters
began to come, he had never imagined himself receiving
one from Barbara. He had had the book
published in order that it might have some chance
of reaching her, of helping her; yet the proof that
she had been reached and helped had come upon him
like a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>Of course he was thankful, now that he put it
to himself in such a way. He ought to be almost
happy, he tried to think; but he was at the world&#8217;s
end from happiness. A hurricane had swept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>through his soul, and it would take him a long time
to build up again the miserable little refuge which
had been his house of peace. Still, it didn&#8217;t matter
about himself. He would write to Barbara, and
give her the assurance she asked for. He was glad
now of a whim that had led him to learn typewriting
two or three years ago, for he could not trust to
disguising his hand so well that she might not recognize
it. It was many months since he had practiced
typing, but he thought that in a few hours he
might again pick up the trick which he could not
quite have lost.</p>

<p>Rather than let himself think any longer, he went
out at once, walking to the town, where he bought
a small typewriter of a new make. Its lettering was
in script, which seemed less offensive and coldly businesslike
for a letter than print. Back again at the
Mirador he tried the machine, and sooner than he
had expected the old facility returned. Then he
was ready to begin his answer to Barbara; but for
a long time he sat with his fingers on the keys, his
eyes fixed upon them aimlessly. It was not that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>could find nothing to say. He could find too many
things, and too many ways of saying those things.
But all were expressions of thoughts which he might
not put on paper for Barbara to read.</p>

<p>Even after he began to type, he took page after
page out of the machine and tore up each one.
Vaguely he felt that the right way was to be laconic;
that he ought to show no emotion, lest he should
show too much. Finally he finished a few paragraphs
which he knew to be lame and halting, like
himself, stiff and altogether inadequate. Yet he
was sure that he would be able to do no better, and
so he determined to send his letter off as it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you are grateful to me,&#8221; Denin began
as abruptly as Barbara had begun in writing to him,
&#8220;but it is for me to be grateful to you really, for
speaking as you do of my story, &#8216;The War Wedding.&#8217;
I am answering your letter the day it has reached me,
because you are anxious to have a reply to your question.
It is what you wished it might be. I <i>have</i>
been very near to death, so near that I seemed to see
across, to the other side of what <i>we</i> think of as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>gulf. If I saw aright, it is not a gulf.... Those
voices of young men passing suddenly over in crowds,
I thought, I believed, and still believe I heard. I
can almost hear them now, because one does not
forget such things <i>if one comes back</i>. I trust this
answer may be of some comfort to you; and if you
can feel, as you say you will feel, that my book has
a message especially for you, I shall be very glad and
proud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours sincerely, John Sanbourne.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he re-read the typed letter, one point struck
him which had not so sharply pierced his intelligence
before. The effect of the appeal from Barbara, the
miracle of its coming, and the poignant obligation
it thrust upon him had been too overpowering at
first. He had not stopped, after breaking short his
wild hope of her freedom, to dwell on the strangeness
of one part of her letter above another. But
now, in judging his own phrases, he came to a stop
at a sentence towards the end of the page: &#8220;I trust
this may be of some comfort to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t that way of putting it sound conceited?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>he asked himself. But no; she had used that very
word &#8220;comfort&#8221; in her letter. As he remembered
this, the thought suddenly woke in him that she had
written as a woman might write who was in deep
sorrow. Yet she could not be in deep sorrow. She
had her heart&#8217;s desire, and at worst, her feeling for
the man who was gone&mdash;John Denin&mdash;could only be
a mild, impersonal grief that his life had to be the
price of her happy love.</p>

<p>He had longed, in writing the story of &#8220;The War
Wedding,&#8221; to show Barbara why even that mild
grief was not needed, because in giving great joy
to another soul a woman earned the right to her own
happiness. Denin could not bear to think that pity
for him might shadow Barbara&#8217;s sunshine, but he
had not dreamed until to-day that the shadow could
be dark. Now, the more intently he studied her
appeal to the author of the book, the more difficult
he found it to understand her state of mind.</p>

<p>Barbara spoke of herself as one of the many
women whose &#8220;sore hearts&#8221; ached for healing because
they were losing their &#8220;dearest&#8221; in battle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>And she said that, if he could give her the assurance
she asked for, the story of &#8220;The War Wedding&#8221;
would seem to hold a personal message, making her
&#8220;future life bearable.&#8221;</p>

<p>What a generous and sensitive nature she had,
and what beautiful loyalty, to mourn sincerely for a
man she had never loved, but to whom she owed a
few material advantages! It was wonderful of the
girl, and he worshiped her for it. His sacrifice for
her was easier because of this warm sense of her gratitude,
and he kissed the paper he had just written on
for her, because some day it would be touched by her
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I only dared to say more to comfort her, and
beg her to be happy!&#8221; he thought. But the one
safe way had been to make his answer to her calmly
impersonal, perhaps even a little cold. For fear he
might be seized with an irresistible desire to add
something more, something from his heart instead of
his head, Denin put the letter into an envelope and
sealed it.</p>

<p>Then, however, he stumbled upon a new difficulty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>which had not occurred to him before. He was in
the act of addressing her as &#8220;Lady Denin&#8221; (since she
chose to keep his name), when his heart stood still
in the face of a danger he had barely escaped.</p>

<p>How was a stranger like John Sanbourne to know
that she was <i>Lady</i> Denin?</p>

<p>If, inadvertently, he had written the name thus,
and sent the letter to the post, even so slight a thing
might have made her guess the truth. Instead of
comforting, he might have plunged her into humiliation
and despair.</p>

<p>Barbara had not spoken of herself in the letter
as being married. For all John Sanbourne was supposed
to know, she might be a girl, mourning a
brother or a lover. At last he addressed her as
&#8220;Mrs. or Miss Denin, Gorston Old Hall.&#8221; And
with several other letters which he forced himself to
write, he enclosed the stamped envelope in a note to
Eversedge Sibley. &#8220;Please post these in New
York,&#8221; he begged. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care to have every one
know where I live.&#8221;</p>

<p class='line center mt3 mb2'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>CHAPTER VIII</p>

<p>It was the day he finished re-plastering the
house-wall, that the celebrity was &#8220;discovered&#8221;
by Santa Barbara.</p>

<p>Denin stood half way up a ladder with a trowel
in his hand, when a young man in a Panama hat and
a natty suit of gray flannels came swinging jauntily
along the path: altogether, a &#8220;natty&#8221; looking young
man. He would probably have chosen the adjective
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning!&#8221; he confidently addressed the
lanky, shirt-sleeved figure on the ladder. &#8220;Do you
happen to know if Mr. John Sanbourne is at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am John Sanbourne,&#8221; said Denin, making no
move to descend the ladder. He wanted to get on
with his work, and expected the newcomer&#8217;s errand,
whatever it might be, would be over and done with
in a minute. He thought that the young man had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>probably come to sell him an encyclopedia or a sewing
machine, because the only other visitors he had
had&mdash;except the postman, and the boy from the
grocer&mdash;had pertinaciously urged that the Mirador
was incomplete without these objects.</p>

<p>The young man looked horrified for an instant,
but being a journalist and used to rude shocks, he
was able hastily to marshal his features and bring
them stiffly to attention. He had already learned
that the Mirador&#8217;s new owner was &#8220;peculiar,&#8221; a sort
of hermit whom nobody called on, because he did
his own work, wore shabby clothes, and made no pretense
of having social eminence. Indeed, it had
never occurred to any one (until the idea jumped
into the reporter&#8217;s brilliant brain) that a person who
could buy and inhabit that half ruined &#8220;doll&#8217;s house&#8221;
could be of importance in the outside world. The
journalist it was who, happening to meet the postman
near the Drake place that morning, saw a
huge envelope addressed to &#8220;John Sanbourne.&#8221; He
flashed out an eager question: &#8220;Is there a John
Sanbourne living near here?&#8221; He was answered:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>&#8220;Yes, a fellow by that name&#8217;s bought the Mirador&#8221;;
quickly elicited a few further details, and, abandoning
another project, arrived when the postman was
out of the way, at the Mirador gate. It was a
blow&mdash;severe if not fatal&mdash;to romance to find John
Sanbourne splashed with whitewash and looking as
a self-respecting mason would be ashamed to look.
But perhaps he was a socialist. That would at least
make an interesting paragraph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you <i>the</i> John Sanbourne, the man who
wrote &#8216;The War Wedding&#8217;?&#8221; the visitor persisted.</p>

<p>Denin was surprised and disconcerted. &#8220;Why do
you ask?&#8221; he sharply answered one question with
another; then added, still more sharply, &#8220;And who
are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Reid. I work for a San Francisco
paper, and I&#8217;m correspondent for one in New York.
If you wrote the book that&#8217;s made such a wonderful
boom, my papers want to get a story about
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. That&#8217;s very kind of you and of
them,&#8221; said Denin coolly. &#8220;But I haven&#8217;t a &#8216;story&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>worth any newspaper&#8217;s getting. I&#8217;m sorry you
should give yourself trouble in vain. Yet so it must
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I say &#8216;a story,&#8217; I mean an article&mdash;an interview,&#8221;
Reid explained to the amateur intelligence.
&#8220;I think,&#8221; he went on, beginning to find possibilities
in the hermit and his surroundings (voice with
charm in it: fine eyes: striking height: peculiar fad
for solitude, etc.)&mdash;&#8220;I think I see my way to something
pretty good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; Denin insisted, speaking with great
civility, because he had suffered too much to inflict
the smallest pin-prick of pain upon any living thing
if it could be avoided. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I must ask you
not to rout me out of my burrow with any searchlight.
You can see for yourself I&#8217;m no figure for a
newspaper paragraph. If the public really takes
the slightest interest in me, for Heaven&#8217;s sake leave
them to their illusions. Please write nothing about
me at all. But I can&#8217;t let you go without asking
you to rest and drink a glass of lemonade. I&#8217;m
ashamed to confess&#8221;&mdash;and he laughed&mdash;&#8220;that I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>nothing stronger to offer you. I lead the simple life
here!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he came down from the ladder, trying
not to show inhospitable reluctance, and invited the
reporter to sit in the shade of the veranda. Reid,
seeing that the man was in earnest, not merely &#8220;playing
to the gallery,&#8221; showed his shrewd journalistic
qualities by acquiescence. He accepted the situation
and the lemonade, and kept his eyes open. He
did not abuse the hermit&#8217;s kindness by outstaying his
welcome, but took leave at the end of fifteen or
twenty minutes. At the gate, he held out his hand
and Sanbourne had to shake it with a good grace.
Noticing for future reference, that the author of
&#8220;The War Wedding&#8221; had a hand as attractive as his
scarred face was plain, Reid said resignedly, &#8220;Well,
Mr. Sanbourne, thank you for entertaining me. But
I&#8217;m sorry you don&#8217;t want me to write about you.
Sure you won&#8217;t change your mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; echoed Sanbourne, and went thankfully
back to put the last touches on the house-wall.
About half an hour later the work was finished,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>and he had time to remember that several letters and
papers, brought by the postman, were lying unopened.
Standing on his ladder, he had asked to
have the budget left on the balcony table. Then he
had forgotten it, for he dreaded rather than looked
forward to the letters of his unknown correspondents;
and even if Barbara acknowledged his answer (which
seemed to him unlikely) it would be many days before
he could expect to hear from her.</p>

<p>This time there was the usual fat envelope,
stuffed with smaller ones, forwarded by Eversedge
Sibley; also there was a letter from Sibley himself.
Denin put off delving into the big envelope, and
opened Sibley&#8217;s. Quite a friendship had developed
between them, and he liked hearing from the publisher,
who wrote about the great events of the world
or advised the reading of certain new books, which
he generally sent in a separate package. Sometimes
he sent newspapers, too, fancying that Sanbourne
saw only the local ones. They were having
a discussion through the post, the American trying
to instruct the Englishman in the intricacies of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>home politics; but the letter which Denin now
opened did not refer to that subject, nor did it finish
with the usual appeal: &#8220;When will the call to
work get hold of you again, or when will the spirit
move you to think of writing me another book?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Sanbourne,&#8221; Sibley began. &#8220;This is an interlude,
to the air of &#8216;Money Musk&#8217;! Our custom,
as you may vaguely have noticed in the contract I
forced you to sign, is to make royalty payments to
our authors twice a year. But you have bought a
house and land, and Heaven knows what all, out of
your advance, you tell me. Seems to me you can&#8217;t
have left yourself much margin. You mentioned
the first day we met that you were a poor man; so I
have unpleasant visions of what our latest star author
may have reduced himself to, while the men whose
job it is to sell his masterpiece are piling up dollars
for his publishers. The check I lay between these
pages (so as to break it to you gently) is only a small
part of what we know the &#8216;Wedding&#8217; to have made
up to date. Never in all my experience has a book
advertised <i>itself</i> as yours seems to have done. One
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>reader tells a dozen others to buy it. Each one of
that dozen spreads the glad tidings among his or her
own dozen. So it goes! The &#8216;Wedding&#8217; has now
been out three months and is in its tenth edition, the
last six whacking big ones. It won&#8217;t stop short of at
least a million, I bet, with Canada, England, and the
Colonies as well as our immense public here. With
this assurance, you can afford to use the present check
as pin money. Yours ever, E. S.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denin turned the page, and saw a folded slip of
yellow paper: a check payable to John Sanbourne
for two thousand five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>He thought no more about the journalist. But
the journalist was busily thinking about him. Mr.
Reid was not writing an &#8220;interview&#8221; with Mr. Sanbourne,
because he had promised he would not do
that. Sanbourne had, luckily for Reid, let his request
stop there. Reid considered himself morally
free to write something else, which did not compose
itself on the lines of an interview. He wrote what
he called &#8220;A Study of John Sanbourne, Author and
Hermit,&#8221; making it as photographic, yet at the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>time as picturesque, as he knew how. Just as an
&#8220;artist photographer&#8221; takes dramatic advantage of
high lights and shadows, so did Reid the reporter put
to their best use the splashes of whitewash on his
celebrity&#8217;s black hair and scarred brown face, and
spots of pink paint on his shirt sleeves. He described
the Mirador as it had been after the fire, and
as it had become since John Sanbourne bought the
little ruined &#8220;doll house&#8221; with its patch of garden
walled off from the Drake (once the Fay) place,
near Santa Barbara. He mentioned his own surprise
at finding so famous a man voluntarily hidden
from the world, in these quaint surroundings, when,
if he chose, he could be fêted by &#8220;everybody who was
anybody&#8221; for miles around.</p>

<p>When Reid had finished his &#8220;study,&#8221; he was as
proud of it as his victim was of the plaster and paint
on the Mirador walls. It was too good, thought the
journalist, for a local paper. Why, it was a regular
&#8220;scoop&#8221;! He would send it &#8220;on spec.&#8221; to the <i>New
York Comet</i> which occasionally accepted an article
from him. This, he had no doubt, would not only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>be accepted but snapped at, for the great Sunday
supplement which the <i>Comet</i> brought out. In that
case, he would get a good price for his work, far
better than local pay, to say nothing of the kudos;
and as a queer fish like Sanbourne wasn&#8217;t likely to
&#8220;run to&#8221; the Sunday <i>Comet</i>, or to a press-cutting
subscription, he would probably never see the
&#8220;stuff.&#8221; This thought relieved Reid of his one anxiety.
Sanbourne had trusted him. And the difference
between an &#8220;interview&#8221; and a &#8220;study&#8221; was
perhaps too subtle for an outsider to understand.</p>

<p>As it happened, Mr. Reid was right in all three
of his suppositions. The New York <i>Comet</i> did approve
his manuscript: theirs was a dignified cross between
accepting and snapping. John Sanbourne
did not see the Sunday supplement, nor did he take
in any of the many newspapers which quoted it. He
did not subscribe to a press-cutting bureau; and the
agencies which had applied for his patronage, being
discouraged by his silence, did not send to him.</p>

<p>Eversedge Sibley, on the other hand, always saw
the Sunday supplement of the <i>Comet</i>, which specialized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>on literary subjects. He read the &#8220;Study of
John Sanbourne, Author and Hermit,&#8221; and was astonished
that so retiring, almost mysterious a person,
had granted it. On further deliberation, however,
Sibley decided that material for the article must have
been got on false pretenses. He read the &#8220;stuff&#8221;
through again, and felt that, though interesting to
the public, Sanbourne would think it hateful. If
a journalist had caught him unawares, he would be
distressed to find his privacy so violated; and Eversedge
Sibley did not want Sanbourne to be distressed.
Consequently he did not forward the supplement,
nor the cutting his firm afterwards received of it;
and as no one else thought of sending, Sanbourne
continued peacefully to forget his morning visit
from a journalist. Even the fact that he was stared
at in the street more intently than he had been at
first, when an errand took him into town, did not remind
him of the call or cause him to put two and
two together. He did not indeed know that he was
being stared at. He did not look much at people,
because he did not wish to be looked at. And his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>thoughts were more for the place and the scenery
which Barbara had loved and he was learning to love
than for his fellow creatures, who seemed infinitely
remote from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How wonderful that that John Sanbourne who
wrote &#8216;The War Wedding&#8217; should be here, and none
of us even dare try to get to know him!&#8221; some
women said, when they had seen extracts from Reid&#8217;s
&#8220;study&#8221; in newspapers they took in. These women
thought Sanbourne&#8217;s scars actually attractive.
Others announced that they didn&#8217;t believe the man
<i>was</i> the real John Sanbourne. There must be some
mistake. <i>This</i> one didn&#8217;t look like a gentleman.
At least his clothes didn&#8217;t. And <i>anybody</i> could pretend
to be John Sanbourne if they liked. Lots of
frauds did that sort of thing when a novel by an
unknown author made a great success.</p>

<p>John Sanbourne felt richer with his new check
and the astonishing prospect held out by Sibley than
Sir John Denin had ever felt at Gorston Old Hall
with his big income. But his one extravagance was
to buy some books and shelves to put them on. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>that way he soon collected all his old, best friends
around him; for that was the one joy of having
books for friends. No matter where you went, you
could always send for them and have them with you.
You could never be entirely alone in the world.</p>

<p>When the time came that Denin might receive a
letter from Barbara, he tried not to think of it.
He said to himself that he knew it would not come,
that he ought not to want it to come, that if it did
come, it would only prolong the agony. He read
hard, and worked hard in the garden, and took long
walks, though he limped slightly still, for he was
losing the worst of his lameness and might actually
hope to become in the end (as the German surgeon
had prophesied) as &#8220;good a man as he had ever
been.&#8221; Perhaps in some ways&mdash;ways of the mind
and spirit&mdash;he was better. But there was no soul-doctor
to judge of such improvement. Certainly
Denin was unable to do so himself.</p>

<p>Nothing on earth or in heaven could distract his
thoughts from the letter, however, when it began to
loom before him as a possibility. Constantly he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>found himself saying, &#8220;To-morrow it might come.&#8221;
And then, &#8220;To-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>When it was &#8220;to-day,&#8221; he began courageously to
plan an excursion which for some time he had been
meaning to make. If he left early in the morning&mdash;long
before the postman was due&mdash;he need not get
back till night. But his strength failed at the moment
of starting. He went no farther than the gate.
<i>Should</i> there be a letter while he was away, the
postman must leave it on the table outside the house,
for the door would be locked. Then, Denin argued,
if any mischievous person should slip in and
steal it, he would never know what he had missed.
And he was rewarded for staying. The letter did
come. It was only when he held it in his hand that
he realized how desperately he had wanted it, what
a black dungeon the beautiful summer day of sunshine
would have been without it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you more than I can say for answering
me!&#8221; he read. &#8220;You wrote me on the very day you
had my letter, and I am doing the same with yours,
for it has just arrived. Now, since you have told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>me you <i>heard the voices with the ears of your own
spirit</i>, the book can be mine&mdash;my own message,
meant for me. Perhaps others say this very same
thing to you&mdash;though it seems that no one can need
such a message as much as I need it. I wonder if
it would be wrong to tell you why?</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe your first thought when I ask that question,
will be&mdash;why should I <i>want</i> to tell you? But
if I do tell you, then you will see why. We are
strangers to each other, living thousands of miles
apart, and we shall never meet; yet because you have
written this book, I feel that you are my friend.
You have helped me as no one else could. And I
have no one else to help me at all&mdash;<i>no one</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I must tell you!&mdash;for in one way I and the
girl in your story have lived through the same experience.
Only there is one great difference between
us. She didn&#8217;t love the man she married, and that
hurt her, in thinking of him afterwards when he
was dead. I loved the man I married so much that
it is killing me because I didn&#8217;t tell him. There
was a reason why I didn&#8217;t tell. It seemed then that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>I could not. But oh, do you, who know so much,
think he understands now, and does he still care, or
is he too far away? Could he understand my having
done a thing since he went, a thing that looks
like disloyalty&mdash;treason&mdash;to his memory, though indeed
it was not that. It was done to save a life.
You will say, &#8216;This is a mad woman who asks me
such questions.&#8217; But I almost wish I were mad. If
I were, I mightn&#8217;t realize how I suffer. Yours&mdash;Barbara
Denin.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was stunned by the letter, and its revelation.
She had <i>loved him</i>.</p>

<p class='line center mt3 mb2'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>CHAPTER IX</p>

<p>The thought filled the man&#8217;s soul and surrounded
it as water fills and surrounds a ring
fallen into the sea. Barbara had loved him. There
was nothing in the world outside that thought.</p>

<p>At first, it caught him up to heaven, and then
just as he saw the light, it flung him down to hell.</p>

<p>Fool that he had been, never to see the truth under
her reserve, while seeing would have meant standing
by her, keeping her forever! But he had let her
go, and it was too late now, even for explanations.
He had shut an iron door between them; and standing
with her on the other side of that door was a
man who called her his wife. There was the situation;
and he, by his silence, had created it. He was
condemned to perpetual silence; for it was the wildest,
most hopeless mockery of all which brought to
John Sanbourne a knowledge of Barbara&#8217;s love for
John Denin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>Fate had been laughing at him while he wrote his
book with a message of peace for her, laughing
wicked and cruel laughter, because through the message
he was to come into touch with Barbara and
learn the tragic failure of his sacrifice. That seemed
to Denin a vile trick for life to play upon a man,
and whipped by the seven devils of thwarted love
which had entered into him he cursed it; cursed life
and fate, himself and Trevor d&#8217;Arcy, and was ready
to deny Justice, even Justice blindfolded.</p>

<p>His heaven lasted for a moment at best. For
many hours Cain and Abel in him fought each other
in hell. But he had been down in depths well nigh
as black, and had struggled out to the light. Remembering
this, he struggled out once more, at last,
and perceived that, somehow, to his own wondering
surprise, he had stumbled up to a higher level and a
stronger footing than before. Within distant sight
he visioned those serene mountain tops where light
is, the light that never shines on sea or land for
those who have not suffered.</p>

<p>Only a short time ago he had begun daily to realize
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>and tell himself that strength and steadfastness
alone really mattered; that suffering was but a flame
which passed. This was still true, as true as it had
ever been. A man could choose whether the flame
should consume or purify him in its passing; and
here and now the immediate hour of his choice was
on the stroke. At the end of that day of turmoil,
Denin seemed still to be looking down at himself,
as a crouching prisoner in a dark underground cell.
Yet he knew that he was his own prisoner, not really
a helpless captive of the Fate he had cursed. Fate
had no power after all to make men prisoners. It
was their business to find this out, and to prove that
they had only to release themselves, in order to be
free. He felt this to be an abstract fact of life;
and if he meant to live he must make it concrete.</p>

<p>The underground hole where he so miserably
crouched was but the cellar of his darkest self. If
he but thought so, he had strength enough in him
to fight his way up into the high, bright tower
which was also himself, a tower with a wide view on
every side, over the sunlit mountains from whose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>peaks he could already catch some glimmering vision.</p>

<p>Even the thought of the mountain tops&mdash;that they
were there, shining, and always had been and always
would be&mdash;made Denin lift his head and draw deep
breaths into his lungs. That part of him which had
yearned to write the book for Barbara and had conquered
difficulties to write it, came like a strong
brother to the rescue of a weak brother and pulled
him up by main force out of the dark. He tried to
reassure himself, over and over, that he need never
again crawl back into the darkness. He had seen
the view from the tower, and the tower was his to
reach.</p>

<p>Denin had not worked out for his own guidance
any clear-cut philosophy of life. He had just stumbled
along with strength for his goal mark, trying
now and then to recall some whisper or note of music
he had caught from the other side before he came
back. He had written down in his book, for Barbara,
all that had been tangible under his pen.
But now, knowing she had loved him, he saw how
much more help she needed than he had given,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>and how much more&mdash;how very much more&mdash;he
owed her.</p>

<p>Not that he had deliberately stood aside and left
the girl unprotected. When in the German hospital
he had drifted back to a knowledge of realities past
and present, he had seen almost at once that, even
if the news were unwelcome, he must not let his
wife live in ignorance that she was still bound. It
was only after hearing from Severne of Barbara&#8217;s
marriage to d&#8217;Arcy, that he had said, &#8220;John Denin
is dead and buried, and his ghost laid.&#8221; He had
meant to make the supreme sacrifice for Barbara&#8217;s
good, and there had been no shadow of doubt in his
mind that he was right in making it. Now he asked
himself if even then it might not have been best to
let the truth come out. No one was to blame for the
mistake in a dead man&#8217;s identity, nor for what had
happened afterwards through that mistake. Barbara
would have had a hard choice before her; yet
she might, if she possessed strength and courage
enough, have chosen from the two men who had
come into her life, the one she loved. The whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>world would have rung with the tragic story, but at
the end Barbara might have lived down the tragedy.
If he had been her choice, he would have helped her
to live it down, by the gift of such love as no man
had ever given to a woman.</p>

<p>As it was, he had dared to play the potter. He
had taken the clay of Barbara&#8217;s destiny into his own
awkward hands, to shape it as he thought best, and
he had let the vase break in the furnace. He could
never make it what, but for his meddling, it might
have been; yet he must piece the delicate fragments
together if he could, not caring for&mdash;not thinking
of&mdash;his bleeding hands.</p>

<p>This, then, was the debt Denin owed to Barbara.
And to pay it he saw that he must begin by remaking
himself, before he could give her anything worth
the having. He must become a thing of value, in
order to be of value to her. Those faint whispers
and snatches of music from the other side of the
hidden river, which he had jumbled into &#8220;The War
Wedding,&#8221; confusedly, hurriedly, fearing to lose
their echoes, he must now carefully gather up again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>and sort out with method. He must dip into his
brain where half-remembered thoughts seethed in
solution. He must see the rainbow in every tear
drop, and crystallize it into a jewel for Barbara.
Thus developing himself, he might have some
worthy offering for her at last.</p>

<p>He could not write that day, nor the next, for it
seemed that the only things worth saying were the
things which would not let themselves be said, things
which swept through the background of his mind
like a flight of chiming bells in the night, elusive as
waiting souls for which no bodies have yet been
made. But though he could not write, he called
thoughts, which he had once seen and let go, to come
again to him. He sent himself back along the road
he had traveled beyond the milestones. He searched
by the wayside for beautiful memories he had
dropped there, and some of them he found grown up
tall and white as lilies in moonlight. Whatever he
found was for Barbara.</p>

<p>On the third night after the revelation, he had
gathered something to give her, and strength enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>to feel sure he would not put into his letter the
question which must not be asked: &#8220;What was the
reason you couldn&#8217;t tell your husband that you
loved him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Denin wrote with a typewriter, as he had written
before, on blank paper with no address, because it
was better for Barbara to come in touch with him
only through his publishers. In that way, she would
be spared any sense of constraint she might have to
feel in knowing that he lived among her neighbors
of long ago. She had given him her name frankly,
and she might fear some inadvertent mention of it to
people she had met as a child. If he were to be of
real use to her, he thought, he must be known only
as a distant Voice, an Ear, a Sympathy, almost impersonal
outside his letters.</p>

<p>Denin wrote to her that he was sure, entirely sure,
the man she loved was &#8220;not too far away to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will only have to send him a thought, and
it must reach him behind that very thin wall we call
death. The way I imagine it, such a message goes
where it&#8217;s directed, just as when we call &#8216;Central&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>through the telephone. They, whom we speak of as
dead, have their own work to do and their own life
to live, so perhaps they don&#8217;t think of us every moment.
But surely we&#8217;ve only to call. They may
not see us in the flesh, any more than we can see
them in the spirit; but it came to me when I was
very close to the other side, that our bodies don&#8217;t
enclose us quite. We&#8217;re half-open jewel-boxes, that
let out flashes of emerald, or sapphire, or diamond
light, according to the strength of our vibrations&mdash;or
aspirations, if you like (I begin to realize that
these are much the same thing!). It is the flashes
of light which are seen and recognized by the ones
who have passed farther on. The lights are our
images, as well as messages for them. But when I
say &#8216;farther on,&#8217; it&#8217;s only a figure of speech. They
are not far off.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can see the rain. We can&#8217;t see the wind,
even when it is so close we can lean on it like a wall.
And so we can lean on their love, strong as a wall,
stronger than anything visible to us, because love is
the strongest thing there is. You see, life wouldn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>be worth living for any of us&mdash;it wouldn&#8217;t have
been worth creating&mdash;if the dead really died. The
glory of the deathless dead lights our way, with the
bright deeds they have done, till we come where we
can see for ourselves that there&#8217;s no dividing line.
&#8216;The milestones end.&#8217; That&#8217;s all. They&#8217;re not
needed any more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard other people talking of these things
when I went where the milestones end. Since then
I&#8217;ve wondered why I didn&#8217;t know the things before.
<i>Listen to your hopes</i>, and <i>you</i> can know without
waiting; because hope is the voice of instinctive
knowledge, and soul-instinct is what we were <i>born</i>
knowing. Believe this, and you won&#8217;t have to stumble
slowly up, as I did, with a hod full of old precepts
on my back. You can plane down from the
sky with your arms full of stars, and live with them,
as I live with the flowers in my garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;The accident which put me into close touch with
what we call &#8216;death,&#8217; put me out of touch&mdash;mentally&mdash;with life
on this side for a while. An operation
brought me back. Just as, hovering between the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>known and the unknown, I let my past drop, so on
my return to it I had for a while no memories of
the borderland. My brain busied itself picking up
lost threads. I recalled the instant when I thought
I was meeting death: a great shock when all supports
fell away as from under a ship that is launched, and
I plunged into measureless depths. Beyond that
sensation, there was blankness. By and by glimpses
of something bright came and went, oftenest in
dreams. The effort to seize their meaning waked
me with a start. It is only now that I am beginning
to hold some of the best meanings, I think. I have
come back with a little star-dust, even I; and by its
glimmer, in good moments, I try to interpret my own
dreams.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I read them rightly, I&#8217;ve told you only an
old, old truth in saying that there should be no such
word as death, or grief for it among the living.
We&#8217;ve only to lift the veil of Death to see the face
of Life&mdash;a wonderful, shining face with no pain in
its smile. Looking into its eyes, what we do, instead
of &#8216;dying,&#8217; is to flow over our own narrow limitations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>as growing vines flow over the high wall of a
little garden. We escape out of bounds into the
boundless and are part of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, then, let the life of the man you have
loved be darkened by feeling that he has darkened
yours. Stand up, lift your head, and you&#8217;ll see how
your sorrow will have to lie down at your feet as
shadows lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Denin ended his letter, he found that in
trying to help Barbara, he had helped and heartened
himself. He had unfolded a flag and waved it to
the sky.</p>

<p>He went out, though it was after midnight, and
posted the letter. Later, he was able to sleep as he
had not slept since the night he wrote the last words
of his book. As usual he dreamed of Barbara, but
this time it was a new dream. He saw himself
painting her portrait; and when he waked in the sunrise
he wondered why he had never tried to paint
such a likeness from memory. He could see her as
clearly before him as though she had come to the
door, opened it, and looked at him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>The thought gave him something more to live for.
He would do the picture, and so bring Barbara herself
to the Mirador where, guessing nothing of the
truth, she sent her thoughts to John Sanbourne.</p>

<p class='line center mt3 mb2'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>CHAPTER X</p>

<p>It seemed to Denin that he knew the day and
even the moment when his letter reached Barbara.</p>

<p>He was working on her portrait, to which he gave
every instant of his spare time between dawn and
dusk. A strange, elusive impression of a girl it was;
a girl in white looking through a half-open door.
She stood in shadow, but leaning forward a little so
that her eyes and hair and a long fold of her dress
caught the light. Denin&#8217;s portrait work before had
been done with charcoal or colored chalk. Such
mediums were too crude, however, for this labor of
his love. He was trying pastels, and had expected
to make many false starts and failures. But he had
only to open the door to see the girl standing just
outside, looking straight at him with smoke-blue eyes
under level brows and warm shadow of copper-beech
hair; so after all he could not go wrong with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>work. He had but to paint what he saw, and the
picture took life quickly, as his book had taken life,
because it was easier to go on than to stop. One
evening, he was straining his eyes for the last ray of
daylight, when a blue flash seemed to leap from the
eyes of the portrait. He could hardly believe that
it was only an illusion of an overworked optic nerve.
It was as if Barbara had somehow found out about
the portrait, and compelled it to speak for her, to
tell him something she wished to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has got the letter!&#8221; was the thought that
compelled his mind to accept it. And then&mdash;&#8220;She
will answer at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The difference in time between Santa Barbara
and Gorston Old Hall was about twelve hours; and
fifteen days ago, he had posted his letter. It was
just possible, even in war-time delays, that it had
reached her, he calculated, as the eyes of the portrait
held him spellbound.</p>

<p>When the picture was finished, he took its measurements
and ordered a glass to protect the fragile
colors, delicate as the microscopic plumes of a moth&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>wing. But he could not content himself with any
design for a frame. He went to shop after shop,
and even traveled as far as Los Angeles, in the hope
of finding the right thing. But nothing was right
as a frame for Barbara. The handsomer a frame
was, the more conventional and banal it looked in
Denin&#8217;s eyes, when he tried to associate it with her.
At last he decided to carve out the frame with his
own hands, from the beautiful fluted redwood of the
great sequoias of California: wonderful, ruddy wood
with an auburn sheen and a wave running through
it like that of Barbara&#8217;s hair.</p>

<p>The idea seized him and brought extraordinary
delight. He took three lessons from an astonished
cabinet-maker of whom he was able to buy the redwood,
and then with confidence and joy began his
work. In two days it was finished, and the picture
in place. It was almost as if he had built a house
for Barbara, and she had come to live in it, and look
out of the door at him.</p>

<p>The portrait was half life-size; and rimmed in its
rich fluted setting of redwood a thousand years old,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>it was of exactly the right length and shape to hang
on the door of child-Barbara&#8217;s bedroom&mdash;his bedroom
now. It was for that place he had planned it,
because in these days he had lost the unbroken privacy
of his first weeks at the Mirador. John Sanbourne
had been &#8220;discovered,&#8221; and without churlishness
was unable to remain any longer a hermit. He
went nowhere, except for the long, solitary walks
he loved, and refused all invitations, but he could
not lock his gate against the three or four kindly
persons who ventured with the best intentions, to
&#8220;dig him up&#8221; and &#8220;keep him from being lonely.&#8221;
His memory-portrait of Barbara was too strikingly
like her, in its strange impressionist way, not to be
in danger of recognition by some old acquaintance
of her childhood. Besides, a picture of his love,
even if unrecognized, was far too sacred to be seen
by stranger eyes. In Denin&#8217;s bedroom the smiling
visitant was safe. No one but himself ever went
there. And with the heavy frame firmly clamped to
the door panels, the effect of the girl gazing out into
the room was thrillingly intensified for Denin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>Thus hung, the portrait was opposite his camp bed;
and when he waked at sunrise, Barbara and he looked
at each other.</p>

<p>The picture had been in its place for a day when
her letter came, a very thick letter; and with the envelope
uncut he went up to sit before her likeness
and read what she had to say to John Sanbourne.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a lifeline thrown to me!&#8221; he read. &#8220;I
grasp it thankfully. I wonder if you will think me
a silly, sentimental creature, if I tell you that even
before I opened your letter a strong golden current
seemed to come out through the envelope into my
fingers, and up my arm? If you were just an ordinary
friend, a man, living near me, I shouldn&#8217;t
be able to say this to you, or tell you that I put your
letter like a talisman inside my dress, so as to keep
it near me, and not lose the sense of its influence
after I had read it three times over. But to <i>you</i> at
your distance I can tell many things that are sacred,
because I&#8217;m only a shadow to you, not a flesh-and-blood
woman, with all my faults and foolishnesses
under your eyes to be judged. I&#8217;m a shadow to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>you, and I don&#8217;t mind being a shadow, because it
gives me freedom and liberty. Yet I mustn&#8217;t abuse
that liberty, and deceive you, my friend so far off&mdash;and
so near. I&#8217;m afraid that I have deceived you
already, and asked for your sympathy, your help,
under false pretenses. Perhaps if you&#8217;d known the
real truth about me and my life, you would have
written me a terribly different letter. Whenever I
am feeling the comfort of it most, suddenly that
thought pierces through me, very cold and deadly,
like a spear of ice. I <i>want</i> the comfort&mdash;oh, how I
want it!&mdash;and so, to make sure whether I have the
right to take it or not, I am going to tell you everything.
You will not be bored, or think me egotistic.
I know you well enough, through your book and
your letters, to be sure of that. When you have
read this, you will be able to judge whether I can
dare to claim the consolation you offer me, and
whether I have a right to comfort myself with those
thoughts, about the only man I have loved or shall
ever love. Because, I have given another man a
place in my outer life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>&#8220;What thought comes into your mind when you
read those words&mdash;cold-hearted, horrible, disloyal
words? Do you slam the door of your sympathy in
my face, and turn me away? No, please, please
don&#8217;t do that&mdash;anyhow don&#8217;t do it quite yet. Wait
till I&#8217;ve explained as well as I can&mdash;if any explanation
is possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to know all the truth and understand
entirely, so I must even tell you a thing that seems
absurd to tell. It would be absurd, if it were not
for the thing&#8217;s consequences. When I was fourteen
my mother and I came away from America, where
we&#8217;d lived ever since I was born, came to live in
Paris, though she is English by birth. A cousin
of hers, an officer in the British army, was on leave
from his regiment just then. He ran over to Paris,
to amuse himself, not to see us; but as he knew we
were there, he called. He was twenty-seven&mdash;thirteen
years older than I&mdash;and I thought he was
like all the heroes of all the novels I&#8217;d ever read, in
the form of one perfectly handsome, perfectly fascinating
man. He treated me like a child, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>teased me a little about being a &#8216;flapper,&#8217; but that
only made me look up to him more, because he
seemed so high above me, and wonderful and unattainable,
like a prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he saw how I felt, and gloried in it as
great fun. He gave me his picture in uniform, and
I worshiped it humbly, as a little Eastern girl might
worship an idol. Soon he went to India, but I saw
him once again, nearly two years afterwards, when I
was almost sixteen. I had never forgotten my
&#8216;prince,&#8217; and after he came back he flirted with me&mdash;rather cruelly,
I think. When I realized&mdash;just
as he was saying good-by, that he&#8217;d only been playing
a little, it all but broke my heart&mdash;what I
thought was my heart. I used actually to <i>enjoy</i> being
miserable, and telling myself I should never love
again&mdash;just as if I&#8217;d been a grown-up woman. I
was even angry with my frivolous self when I found
that I was getting over it. For I did get over it
very soon, and before I was seventeen I could look
back and laugh at my childish silliness. That was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>over five years ago, for I am twenty-two now; and
all my real life has come since then.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother and I were poor, until a little while
ago. She is very good really and very charming,
and absolutely unselfish, so I&#8217;m not picking flaws
in her if I have to explain to you that she was selfish
for <i>me</i>. Being English herself, she has always
thought&mdash;in spite of marrying an American and going
to live in America&mdash;that there&#8217;s nothing quite so
good in the world as the best kind of English life.
By the &#8216;best kind,&#8217; she means life among the aristocracy,
in country houses, and in London in the
season. She made up her mind before I was eighteen
that she wanted me some day to marry a man
who could give me just that life. I used to laugh
then, when she mapped out my future. It seemed
only funny, not vulgar and horrid to talk about
marrying some vague, imaginary man for his title
and money; but when Mother took a house in London&mdash;a
better house than we could afford&mdash;and went
into debt to buy me heaps of lovely clothes, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>fussed and schemed to get me presented and dragged
into the &#8216;right set,&#8217; I began to be ashamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before we had been in London very long I met a
man who was different from any one I had ever seen
before. From the first night, when we were introduced
at a dance, I could think about no one else.
I wish I could make you understand what he was
like, for then you would see how a woman who cared
about him could never stop caring, even when he was
dead; for no other man could at all take his place.
He wasn&#8217;t handsome, not even what people would
call &#8216;good looking,&#8217; I suppose, and he didn&#8217;t talk
very much. But somehow, when he came into a
room with lots of other men in it, all the rest simply
ceased to count. He was very tall, and a great
athlete. Maybe that was one thing that pleased a
woman, for we do like strength&mdash;we can&#8217;t help it.
But there was so much more about him, magnetic
and sincere and splendid, which would somehow
have made one feel that he was near, if one were
<i>blind!</i> He could do all the things other men do
better than any of the others, yet he had thoughts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>such as none of the others had. One knew that a
woman could have no moods or imaginings beyond
his power to understand, if he cared enough, because
he was <i>fine</i>&mdash;&#8216;fine&#8217; in the French meaning of the
word&mdash;as well as strong. I shall never forget the
first time he looked at me. We had just been introduced.
There was something wonderful about
his eyes&mdash;I could hardly tell you what it was. But
one suddenly felt caught and drawn into them, as
into a vortex in deep, still water, clear and pure,
though dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw that he rather liked me, and even that
meant a good deal from him, because he was a man&#8217;s
man, and didn&#8217;t care much about laughing and talking
with lots of girls. Perhaps he was shy of them.
Mother saw, too, that he was interested; and that was
what began all the trouble, because he was exactly
what she had set her heart on for me. She wouldn&#8217;t
leave him alone to make up his mind whether he
really wanted to see more of me or not. She tried
to <i>force</i> him to want me. She did all she could to
bring us together. She left no stone unturned. To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>me it was sickening. I don&#8217;t know whether he saw
it or not, but I was so afraid he might, and be disgusted
with us both, that it made me feel absolutely
ill. I could never be at ease with him. It was
hateful, hateful that he should think my mother and
I were trying to &#8216;catch&#8217; him, because of his title
and money, and his beautiful old house which every
one admired and talked about, and heaps of women
wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;After we had known him for awhile, mother
hinted and hinted for us to be invited to stay at his
place. It was almost like asking him to marry me&mdash;at least I
felt it was. He was obliged to get up a
house-party for us, so that we shouldn&#8217;t be alone,
for he had no mother or aunt or any one to entertain
for him. We and the others were invited for a week,
but the day everybody was going on somewhere else,
mother was taken ill, so she and I had to stay. I
was sure she was pretending, though she wouldn&#8217;t
confess, and I was almost wild with misery and
shame, I loved him so <i>dreadfully</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;For days mother kept her room, and when she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>came down she seemed so weak, that of course he
begged us not to think of going. A fortnight more
passed like that. Then the first rumors of war began;
and we were still with him when war was declared.
That same day, out in a garden by a lake
we both loved, he told me he <i>cared</i>, and asked if I
would marry him before he went off to fight. If
only I could have been sure that he did really care,
and hadn&#8217;t been drawn on by things mother had
said, I should have been divinely happy. But I
wasn&#8217;t sure. I wasn&#8217;t at all sure. And the shame
and suffering I felt, and the fear of showing that I
adored the ground he walked on, when perhaps he
was only being chivalrous to me, made me behave
like a <i>beast</i>. I was just a sullen lump. I said yes,
I would marry him, if he was quite, quite sure he
wanted me to; and then mother came out of the
house, and straight to us, as if she had known exactly
what was going on and could hardly wait to
make certain of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had to go so soon, to rejoin his old regiment,
and leave for the front, that he got a special license,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>and we were married when we had been engaged
just two days. If he did love me&mdash;and looking back
I almost believe now that he did, for he was too true
as well as strong to be &#8216;trapped&#8217; by any woman&mdash;I
must have hurt him by keeping him so at a distance.
He couldn&#8217;t have understood, not even with the
wonderful power he had of seeing deep into people,
all the way through to their souls. But now I have
explained to you about mother, <i>you</i> will understand.
We were hardly alone together, he and I,
for more than five minutes at a time. I always made
some excuse to escape. I was afraid if I were with
him for long I should break down and be a fool.
And I thought if he didn&#8217;t love me I should certainly
disgust him by crying. Mother had told me often,
when she was training me to &#8216;come out&#8217; in society,
that a man must love a woman <i>very</i> much, not to be
irritated with her when she cries, and her face
crinkles up and her nose gets red.</p>

<p>&#8220;After our wedding he was with me for about an
hour, but mother was with us too, for half the
time, and even when she left us alone in an ostentatious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>sort of way, I could think of nothing to say to
him, nothing at all. There were a thousand things
in my brain, will-o&#8217;-the-wisp things, but my tongue
could not catch up with them. I let him go. And
then it was too late.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three weeks afterwards, he died, saving the life
of a friend. So now you see what your book meant
to me, very specially, and why I begged you to tell
me whether you had found out these wonderful
things by going down close to death yourself. You
know why it wasn&#8217;t enough even when you answered
as you did at first. I longed to hear whether you
thought <i>he</i> would know the truth about me. Your
answer to that question is all I hoped for, and more.
But I don&#8217;t deserve it, for I am married now to my
cousin&mdash;the one I so childishly made an idol of when
I was a little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are shocked. You think of me with horror.
You are sorry you have troubled with me at
all. When you read at the beginning of this letter
that I had given another man a &#8216;place in my life,&#8217;
you didn&#8217;t dream that I had <i>married him</i>. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>so it is. Eight months after my love died, and my
youth died with him, I was my cousin&#8217;s wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t tell you much about that. Only this:
a month after I was a widow, this cousin came to
England, wounded. My mother and I were helping
the nurses as best we knew how, in the private hospital
of a friend. My cousin arranged to be sent
there. He wasn&#8217;t seriously hurt, and we saw something
of him, of course. He was immensely changed
from the old days. Because he might have been a
stick or a stone instead of a man for all I cared, he
was piqued, I suppose. He told mother that he
meant to make me fall in love with him and marry
him when the war was over. And when he had
gone back to the front again, she repeated what he
had said to me. You see, she didn&#8217;t know how I
had loved <i>the other</i>, so she was surprised at the way
I took the message. I couldn&#8217;t help showing that
I was angry because he had <i>dared</i>. He wrote to me
later, more than once, but I didn&#8217;t answer his letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Months afterwards, he was horribly wounded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>As he had no near relatives, he asked to have us
sent for, to Boulogne. He was supposed to be dying,
and we couldn&#8217;t refuse to go. We never
thought of refusing. It seemed to do him good to
see us, and he grew better. His one wish, he said,
was to die in England. We brought him back&mdash;a
dreadful journey. He grew worse again on the
way, and we were obliged to stop at Folkestone for
two weeks. Then we got him to London, to see a
great specialist for spinal operations. The surgeon
said that such an operation as would have to be made&mdash;if any&mdash;might
kill, and could not cure. At best,
if he lived, my cousin would be an invalid for the
rest of his life. Still, without an operation, he must
surely die. It would be just a question of a few
weeks. My cousin had to be told this by some one,
and the surgeon thought the news of such a verdict
had better be broken to him by a person he cared for.
Mother felt unable to bear the strain, after all she
had gone through. She isn&#8217;t strong, and since last
August she has changed very much. It seems as if,
now that I&#8217;m &#8216;provided for&#8217; (as she says), she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>let herself go. That day, when she asked if I
would tell my cousin what the surgeon said, I was
frightened about her, she trembled so much and suddenly
turned so deathly pale, with bluish lips, and
blue circles round her eyes. Without an instant&#8217;s
hesitation I promised to speak to my cousin. But
I didn&#8217;t realize what the scene would be like, or I
could hardly have faced it. In his weakness he
broke down, as I never saw any one else break down.
He said, if there was no hope of his being made into
a man again, what good would it bring him to be
cut up and hacked about by a surgeon? Besides,
the specialist was the most expensive operator in
England, and he couldn&#8217;t afford such a costly experiment.
The simplest thing would be to put a
revolver to his head, or take an overdose of some
sleeping draft, and so to be out of his misery once
and for all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was unnerved, and begged him to keep up hope
and courage&mdash;not to think about the money, but to
let us lend it. My beloved one left everything to
me; and I was sure, if he were alive, he would wish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>me to make that offer to a brother soldier. I felt,
even while I was speaking, that if <i>I</i> were in my
cousin&#8217;s place, I should refuse the operation because
I&#8217;d rather die than live on as a helpless invalid, a
burden to myself and others. But it wouldn&#8217;t have
been <i>human</i> not to encourage that poor sufferer to
endure existence, if he could. So I tried my best,
and I was very excited and worked up by the sight
of his emotion. Suddenly he spoke again. He
said that without an incentive to live, he wouldn&#8217;t
trouble about the operation, and the only incentive
he could possibly have would be my marrying him,
before he went under the anesthetic. Besides, he
couldn&#8217;t accept money from me, when he saw no
way of repaying it, unless I were his wife. I would
rather he had killed me than force me to make such
a decision as that!</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps if I&#8217;d been calmer, I might have dared
to refuse, realizing that his love of life was very
strong indeed, and that when he had thought things
over, he would surely consent to the operation without
the horrible sacrifice he asked of me. But I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>at the point of breaking down, myself. I couldn&#8217;t
see anything clearly. It seemed to me that I had
to save a life, if it could be saved, at any cost. And
then, my future mattered so little to me then. The
thought in my mind at the time was, that to be the
nurse of a broken soldier who&#8217;d given himself for
his country, was at least a mission in life. As it
was, I had none left. Also, it may be that deep
down under my conscious thought was another: that
according to the surgeon&#8217;s expert opinion, my cousin
was most unlikely to live. Why not give him the incentive
he asked for, to face the ordeal, and let him
die happy&mdash;since that one thing seemed to mean
happiness for him? Almost before I knew what I
was doing, I promised. Then it was sprung upon
me the next day, that if the operation were to be done
at all, it must be done soon. I had to keep my word.
And what followed was a nightmare: a second wedding
by special license, a bedside marriage with a
dying man, words of farewell, and the surgeon and
anesthetist arriving in their white robes&mdash;like undertakers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>&#8220;When I heard that he had come through the
operation with his life, I knew instantly what wicked
hope must have been hiding in my heart. A sickening
disappointment crept like poison through my
blood. I had to do my duty, though, and live up to
the obligations I&#8217;d undertaken so recklessly. After
a few weeks, mother and I brought the invalid home&mdash;to the home
my beloved one had given me! My
life seems to have been one long series of mistakes,
but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve sinned enough to deserve the
punishment I have to endure now. It is too much
for me. How am I to bear it, and keep my soul&#8217;s
honor? The memory of my love, his ways, and his
looks follow me from room to room of his house,
and walk with me by the dear lake, and in the garden
paths. I might have found peace if I&#8217;d left
myself a right to live with that memory. But I
haven&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve put a man in <i>his</i> place, a man whose
body is helpless as that of a little child, yet whose
soul is a giant of hateful jealousy. He is jealous
of the dead. I hadn&#8217;t guessed a man could be like
that. I must tell you no more. I must try not to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>be cruel or utterly disloyal both to living and
dead&mdash;and to my own self-respect, such as I have left.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have kept my love&#8217;s name. I bargained for
that, before I promised my cousin to marry him. It
was the one possession I couldn&#8217;t consent to give up.
If you will stand by me as my friend after all this
that I&#8217;ve told you&mdash;if you can say that, in spite of
everything, I have any right to the comfort you&#8217;ve
given, address your next letter to Lady Denin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours gratefully, from the heart, whatever your
decision may be. B. D.&#8221;</p>

<p class='line center mt3 mb2'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>CHAPTER XI</p>

<p>If he would &#8220;stand by her, as her friend&#8221;?</p>

<p>Denin could not wait to write. He cabled
recklessly. &#8220;You have done no wrong. Take all
the comfort you need. What you suffer is not punishment.
It is martyrdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God help her!&#8221; he prayed. &#8220;And let me help
her, too&mdash;my Barbara!&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought of the girl yearningly, as of a tortured
child with the heart of a woman. His pain
was peace compared to hers; and it was he&mdash;the
blind man he called &#8220;clear-seeing&#8221;&mdash;who had
thrown her to the wolves. If he had not been too
blind to see her love, he would have shown his for
her as he had not dared to show it, that day in the
old garden. Their marriage would have been a real
marriage, binding Barbara so indissolubly to him
that not to save a life could she have broken the
bond. By this time, they would have been together
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>in their home, and not his memory but himself would
follow her through the rooms and by the dreamy lake
at Gorston Old Hall. Yet even so, could he ever
have known the girl from tip to tip of her soul&#8217;s
wings, as he saw himself destined to know her now,
with six thousand miles of sea and land and one
man&#8217;s death and another man&#8217;s life between them?
Would he have learned from her lips and eyes the
delicate truth of an exquisite worship, as he had
learned it to-day from her written tribute to a dead
soldier?</p>

<p>&#8220;My God! She&#8217;s more mine than she could ever
have been if I hadn&#8217;t died for her!&#8221; he heard himself
think aloud. After all, life hadn&#8217;t been laughing
behind his back, while he wrote the book for
Barbara. Though Fate snatched her away from
him with one hand, with the other it gave her back,
irrevocably and forever. It seemed to Denin that,
though nothing could bring them together in body,
nothing could ever separate them in spirit.</p>

<p>When he wrote that same day, he assured her
again, as he had assured her in his cable, that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>had a right to every one of the words of comfort he
had sent. &#8220;And you have a right to lean on that unseen
wall of love I told you about,&#8221; he repeated.
&#8220;It is close to you, and meant to lean on. There
can be no disloyalty to any one in resting against it.
The love that exists for you on the other side of the
Great Sea is too vast to be selfish. It asks nothing
from you that you ought not to give. It only
begs you to be happy, for there&#8217;s a kind of happiness
without which we fall out of tune with the universe.
Don&#8217;t say you can have no happiness of any kind.
Don&#8217;t think it, or that it would be &#8216;wrong&#8217;
or light-minded to be happy if you could. You have
seen life draped in black. But black is a concentration
of all colors. No opal has such lights as a
black opal. The great adventure of life is learning
the terror and the beauty and the splendor of it all
as one and inseparable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to confess that I&#8217;m no guide for you or
any other. I am just groping my way up, out of
my own dark places; but I believe that great secrets
reveal themselves in flashes, just as&mdash;in some mysterious,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>inspired moments&mdash;a sunrise or a sunset tells
you the truth of a thing you&#8217;ve been groping for
years to find out. This obligation to your own soul
(and Heaven knows how many others), the obligation
of <i>happiness</i>&mdash;is one secret which has been
opened for me by a magic key. That key is my
strong wish to be of use to you. It helps me to feel
that I may help you. Perhaps you&#8217;ll care to know
that? And you can help me, and yourself, and the
man who has passed on, by trying to gain the kind of
happiness I speak of. It&#8217;s the kind that makes you
one with the sunlight, a true note in the great music,
ringing in tune with the universe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if you happen to remember about the
music which the man in my book (the man who was
passing) heard over the battlefield, the music of life
for which the music of war and death was only the
bass, the necessary undertone? I caught just a few
snatches of that life music, but once heard it goes
on echoing in the ears, teaching you the harmony
of all things, if you listen deeply enough. Those
young soldiers I tried to write about, who had thrown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>off their bodies, and even their enmities, with the
rags and dirt and blood they left on the battlefield&mdash;they were
listening to the great music, and hearing
in it the call to some special mission which only
they were fitted to fulfil, going to it in the summer
of their youth, before they had grown tired of anything.
I do believe that was more than a dream of
mine; that this torrent of splendid youth, this vast
crowd of ardent souls suddenly rushed from one
plane to another, has some wonderful work to do,
which can be done only by souls who go out with
the wine of courage on their lips. But we others,
we have our mission too. We can&#8217;t perform it if we
make false notes in the music for the passing souls to
hear. And we <i>shall</i> make false notes if we let our
high vibrations drop down weakly to depression&#8217;s
minor tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ll turn away from this idea of
mine. But it&#8217;s one that interests me, as you know,
because you&#8217;ve honored my little book by caring for
it. In the dreams I had of things on the other side
of sight and hearing, I thought that I saw the real
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>meaning of the war&mdash;the hidden cause of this landslide
of civilization. I saw a whole nation scintillating
with dull red vibrations of fear: fear of attack
by other nations, fear of letting neighbors grow
stronger than they. Then I saw the dull red glowing
brighter with vibrations of anger, a furious desire
to grow strong at the expense of others, and to
kill and conquer at any cost. Beautiful blue vibrations
of intellect, and clear green vibrations of hope
and successful perseverance were lost, swallowed up
by the all-pervading blood-red. I saw the heavy
crimson flood spreading into and lowering the golden
vibrations of other great peoples, who had not yet
fallen; and in the strange dream of colors pulsing
through the ether of earth and heaven, I realized the
immensity of the fight; how it reached far beyond
the forces we know, being in truth a battle between
the light of cosmic day and the darkness of cosmic
night. I saw that the danger was defeat of the golden
vibrations by the red which would lower the life-force
of the whole world; but something told me&mdash;some
snatch of the great music which interprets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>secrets&mdash;that progress is an integral, unalterable part
of evolution; that evil, which is only negative good,
can never conquer; and that the gold vibrations must
win in the end. In the dream, that knowledge gave
me rest. It seemed a pronouncement from the tribunal
of the Power which causes all worlds and all
beings to take form and exist by vibrations.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a long homily on my dreams and the
theories I&#8217;m clumsily founding on them. But I am
trying hard myself to vibrate and resound in tune,
because each vibration and each note count quite as
much as individual soldiers count in war. In this
time of earth stress, and after, when civilization is
remaking itself in men&#8217;s minds, with the loyal &#8216;spirit
of the time&#8217; we must all <i>think gold and blue</i>, the gold
of the sun by which our bodies live, blue of the sky
when inspirations come. You&#8217;ll believe me a &#8216;mystic&#8217;
(whatever that misused word may mean!), but
I&#8217;m only trying to see the Reality behind the Thing
upon which I&#8217;ve harped to you already. We are
needing to know the Reality as we never needed such
knowledge before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>&#8220;Be happy then, in the way that unites you with
everything in heaven and on earth, all the sweet,
kind children of Nature close around you, so that
you may learn the different languages of flowers from
their perfumes, and what the trees say in the wind.
You can&#8217;t feel alone in the world if the trees talk to
you, and they will if you open your heart to them.
You will get to know the oak language, the pine, the
elm, the beech languages; and next you will learn
how they and the sea and the rivers and brooks, and
everything else that makes up the music of nature,
give out the same message in a thousand different
ways: <i>Be happy.</i> To be happy with your soul, no
matter what has hurt your body and tried to spoil
your life, is to be strong. Go into your garden, and
walk by the lake you tell me of, and don&#8217;t be afraid
to call the Memory you love to walk with you there
or anywhere. The one you have loved understands
all, and so there could never be even a question of
forgiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denin longed to add to his letter the request that
she would write often; but he would not ask that of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>Barbara. He must be ready to give all that she
wanted, and beg for nothing in return. Perhaps if
she found any small comfort in what he had written
this time, she would be satisfied, and feel that nothing
more was left to be said on either side. This
possibility he tried to keep before his mind, and to
think of even as a probability, in order to soften the
blow of disappointment if he never heard again.
But in his heart he knew that she would write. It
seemed to him when he walked in the little garden
of the Mirador, or stretched his long body on the
warm grass under a big olive tree he loved, that he
could hear her thoughts in the garden of Gorston Old
Hall. With his ear close to the earth the message
Barbara would send by and by seemed to come to
him before it had left her mind and taken form on
paper.</p>

<p>She answered his cable without waiting for the
letter that followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you a thousand times,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
have always something new to thank you for. What
should I have done if your book hadn&#8217;t come to me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>and given me you for my friend? For a little
while, I almost stopped believing in God, for life
looked so cruel, not only to me but to every one&mdash;or
nearly every one&mdash;I know, since the war began.
Far and wide as I looked, I could find no mercy, no
pity. How ungrateful I was, when all the time God
was putting it into your mind to write that book,
and sending your friendship to me when I needed it
as one needs air to breathe!</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, you are teaching me to <i>think?</i> I
feel now as if I had never really <i>thought</i> before. I
just dreamed, or brooded. If <i>he</i> had lived, I should
have learned from him. That is, I should, if our
souls hadn&#8217;t gone on forever being shy of one another.
When I had him with me, I was too busy
loving him and being afraid that he wouldn&#8217;t love
me, to think about anything outside, though his mind
had given my mind a great lift, even then. And another
thing I want to tell you. Your way of thinking
reminds me of him. I believe you must be a
little like him&mdash;mentally, I mean. Believing this
will make me trust and turn to you, as one who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>knows the things I long to know. You have his
name, too, &#8216;John.&#8217; And I am going to sign my
name always after this, not a mere impersonal initial.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am yours, oh, so gratefully, Barbara Denin.</p>

<p>&#8220;P.S. Strange, I didn&#8217;t notice at first where your
cable was dated! I suppose, like the help you send
me, it seemed just to come out of space! But reading
the message again, I broke open the envelope I
had already sealed, to tell you what a throb of the
heart I had in seeing &#8216;Santa Barbara.&#8217; Can it be
that you live at Santa Barbara? I was christened
after that dear old place, because I was born there,
or very near. It&#8217;s good&mdash;it&#8217;s <i>wonderful</i> to have
your words come to me from <i>home</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a direct question which she asked. Did he
live at Santa Barbara? But Denin thought best not
to answer it. She would forget, maybe, or would
suppose that he had been staying for a short time in
California. Each of his letters to her before, though
posted not far from the Mirador itself, had been enclosed
in an envelope to Eversedge Sibley. In all
but one case, other letters to correspondents brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>the author by his book had been sent off in the wrapper
with Barbara&#8217;s. Denin had taken pains to settle
the difficulty of writing to Gorston Old Hall in this
way, in order that neither the name of the woman
nor the name of the place should be remarked by
Sibley. He kept this rule with the letter which followed
Barbara&#8217;s question, but her next broke the plan
in pieces. It crossed one from him, and was written
after receiving his letter about the garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Friend,&#8221; she named him. &#8220;Before I say
anything else&mdash;and I feel that there are a thousand
things, each pressing forward to be said first&mdash;I must
tell you what I have found out. I&#8217;ve learned that
you are living in the house my father built for me.
Of course that won&#8217;t be important to you. Why
should it be so? I have to remind myself over and
over that I am surely just one of many women who
have written to you after reading your book; one of
many women you are kind to, out of the goodness of
your heart, and the knowledge that&#8217;s in it. Can
knowledge be in a <i>heart?</i> Yes, yours is there, I
think, even more than in your brain. I am nothing to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>you except a poor drowning creature to whom you
have held out a firm hand. But the drowning creature
feels that your living in a place she knew and loved
gives her a kind of personal right in you.</p>

<p>&#8220;I read this very morning in a London paper an
extract from a New York one&mdash;an article about John
Sanbourne. Perhaps you never even knew it was
written? I&#8217;m sure you gave no permission to have
it done. I think you would not like the way the man
wrote about you; but I felt, in reading, that he tried
hard to bring his work up to a high level and make
it worthy of the subject. If you realized the good
it has done me to know that you cared enough for
my dear little Mirador to want it for your own, and
to restore it from ruin, why, you <i>could</i> not be so very
angry with the newspaper man!</p>

<p>&#8220;That time in California, when I was a little girl,
seemed a hundred years ago, or even in another
state of existence, till I read the description of you
in your garden&mdash;once my garden. Then that part
of my life came back as if it were yesterday. I can
see the big olive tree, which had been let grow as it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>liked, with all sorts of flowing, dancing gestures of
its branches and twisting of its trunk, the way olives
grow in Italy and the south of France. I used to
call it my &#8216;silver fountain.&#8217; And under it there was
always a look of moonlight, even in the brightest
noon. I do hope nothing has happened to the tree?
Say kind things to the silver fountain from its little
friend Barbara. Write me about it, and tell me,
please, if it means anything fairylike to you as it
did to me. But I know it must, because of what
you say about your garden. How little I thought
when the letter came four days ago, that my long-ago
garden and your garden of now, were one and
the same!</p>

<p>&#8220;That letter was more than a letter. It was a
saving force. Because it was so much to me, and I
wanted to think it all over and over, I couldn&#8217;t have
dared to answer at once in any case. But it came
on an anniversary, August 18th, the day of his passing.
I can&#8217;t say or write the word &#8216;death,&#8217; since I
have begun to learn from you. It was always a
dreadful word, like a bludgeon. But now it&#8217;s impossible.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>For me it has gone out of the language.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you walk in your little California garden of
the Mirador, will it please you at all to know that
you have given me back the joy of the English garden,
the beautiful garden and the lake, and the sweet,
old, history-haunted house which <i>he</i> left to be mine?
Because you, who know so much, say that he understands
and doesn&#8217;t even need to forgive me, I take
your word. I am not afraid to walk with his memory
now. I can speak to it as I shouldn&#8217;t have had
the courage to with him, when he was here in the
flesh. And because of your letter, August 18th was
not a terrible day. It was more like the wedding
day of two spirits than the anniversary of a great
grief, and one of the spirits&mdash;mine&mdash;just released
from prison. Not that it can stay out of prison forever.
It&#8217;s too weak, yet, to feel its freedom for
long at a time. I&#8217;ve had horrible hours, ever since
that day. I shall have them often, I know, for the
thing I have done has made daily life a torture. But
at worst I can steal away by myself sometimes to
read your letters over. They, and my new thoughts,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>will be for me the tonic of courage; and so I can
go on from day to day, not looking too far ahead,
into the dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I haven&#8217;t trespassed upon your time and imposed
upon your great kindness too much already,
will you write me little things about the Mirador
and your life there? Will you, if you take photographs,
send a snapshot of the wee house as it is now,
and perhaps the silver fountain, to&mdash;Your grateful
friend, Barbara Denin?</p>

<p>&#8220;P. S. You will think I am very old-fashioned
and early Victorian about my postscripts, and I
suppose I am, though I don&#8217;t remember tacking many
onto other letters, only those to you. This one is
just a thought put into my head by some of the last
things you said. It is about the war, and it came
to me in the garden on August 18th.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a world war like this, with all its anguish, can
it be meant for the nations, each one that suffers and
strives, to develop by and by a new individuality, a
great unselfish, selfless Self? Can it be that the
Power behind the worlds throws this one now into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>the furnace because development must come for
progress&#8217; sake? When the earth was first created,
every least thing that lived fought for itself, and
there was no holding together in a large way, anywhere.
When civilizations came, they brought no
real improvement, for politics and greed divided nations
against themselves as well as against each other.
Is the true excuse for creation unity, with all the experience
of ages to give it value? If it is so, and
if each nation can attain to unity through sacrifice
and heroism, won&#8217;t the next thing to follow be the
unity of the whole world? Can this be coming to
pass, slowly yet surely, not only with our grain of
sand, but with all the worlds, while the Power who
created watches through the cosmic days you spoke
of? It would make one&#8217;s own tears of sorrow seem
small, if one could believe this; and yet if we did not
grudge the tears, they might count as pearls, poured
into a golden cup, to brim it full of jewels worthy of
God&#8217;s acceptance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps this isn&#8217;t much of a thought. But such
as it is, there has been light in it for me, on dark
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>days. And as I owe it to you, I felt I should like
to tell you about it. It is going to make me realize
more than I could before, the brotherhood of all
men in war time, even the ones we call the enemy.
Why, I used to be stupid and unseeing as a mole!
I hardly thought about common people, pasty-faced
waiters and weedy under-gardeners and grocer&#8217;s boys,
as <i>men</i> at all. Now, out of every town and village
they are marching with their faces turned to the
front, brave and smiling. They are as glorious soldiers
as any, and I pray for them as I would pray
for my own brothers. Is that a step for me towards
the great unity? I wonder&mdash;and hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, I begin to warm myself at the fire your
friendship has kindled. Each letter you write will
be a fresh log piled on to feed the flame.&#8221;</p>

<p class='line center mt3 mb2'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>CHAPTER XII</p>

<p>When Denin wrote again he ventured to give
Barbara the name that she had given him,
&#8220;Dear Friend.&#8221; And he enclosed photographs of
the Mirador, with its flower-draped balcony, and of
the &#8220;silver fountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you say about my helping you is wonderful
to hear, and makes me feel like a comet stuffed
with stars,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;It is a great honor for me
that you care for my letters. It&#8217;s true, as you surmise,
that others have written and do write to the
author of &#8216;The War Wedding,&#8217; and that is an honor
too, in its way. But it&#8217;s an altogether different
way. I can&#8217;t explain why. I won&#8217;t try to explain
why the call you have sent half across the world
is different from any other call. Yet I want you to
believe that it is so, that I count it an immense privilege
to write to you, and an immense delight to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>your answers. What you call your &#8216;gratitude&#8217; is the
highest compliment ever paid to me. In trying to
study out your problems, I have solved some of my
own. In advising you to be happy, I&#8217;ve found a
certain happiness for myself; so you see that I have
far more cause to be grateful to you than you could
possibly have to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;For one thing&mdash;just a small instance&mdash;I had
never taken a photograph in my life, until you asked
me for snapshots of the Mirador garden. In order
to make them for you myself, I learned how. Now
I am deep in it. Do you remember the little room
that is half underground, yet not quite a cellar?
I&#8217;ve turned it into a dark room for developing my
negatives. I was up all one night watching the
birth of my first work. But I don&#8217;t tell you that to
bid for thanks. I did it because I was too infatuated
with the work itself to think of going to bed. These
things I send are crude. I am going to try to become
what they call&mdash;don&#8217;t they?&mdash;an &#8216;artist photographer.&#8217;
When I can give myself a medal for
my achievements, I&#8217;ll take some better pictures for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>you, of the house and garden, and of the Mission and
other places in the neighborhood of your old home
if you would like to have them. Of course it interests
me immensely to know that you once lived
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last sentence Denin added after a long moment
of hesitation. It seemed brutal not to protest
against that humble supposition of Barbara&#8217;s that
her past ownership of the Mirador would be unimportant
to him. But what he burned to say was so
much more, that the few conventional words he
dared to dole out looked churlish in black and white.
Still, he had to let them stand.</p>

<p>After these letters, which crossed, the woman in
England and the man in California caught the habit
of writing to one another oftener than before&mdash;and
differently. They did not wait for something definite
to answer, for their thoughts so rushed to meet
each other that it seemed as if they knew by wireless
what was best to say each time. Often what
they said might have read commonplacely to an outsider,
for now they told each other the little things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>of every-day life. After her first outburst of confidence
and confession, Barbara did not again for
many weeks refer directly to Trevor d&#8217;Arcy. But
Denin thought that he understood, and felt his veins
fill full with a sudden jerk, as do those of a man
electrocuted, when he read, &#8220;I am rather desperate
to-day:&#8221; or, &#8220;To keep myself from going all to
pieces, just now, I turned my thoughts off my own
life, as you turn a tap, and sent them to your garden&mdash;my old
garden of the Mirador. I strolled there
with you, and you consoled me. It was evening.
We were in the pergola (Father&#8217;s old head gardener
used to call it the &#8216;paragolla&#8217;), and I forgot the iron
grayness here that weighs down my spirit. Over
you and me, as we talked, glittered my old, loved
stars of California. And the pergola with its velvet
drapery of leaves and flowers, and the three dark
cypresses barring the sea view at one end, was like
a corridor hung with illuminated tapestry &#8216;come
alive.&#8217; You can&#8217;t think how real it was for a few
minutes, walking there and hearing your generous
words of comfort, like magic balm on a wound that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>only magic balm could heal. I&#8217;ve decided that
when things are very bad with me here, I&#8217;ll try that
way of escape again. I will send my thoughts to
the Mirador garden, and the comfort that nobody
but you&mdash;who understand so marvelously&mdash;can even
be <i>asked</i> to give. Do you mind my flying to you?
Will you &#8216;pretend&#8217; too, sometimes in those starlit
nights, that I have come to ask your advice and
help? Will you feel as if I were actually there,
and will you put the advice into words? Maybe
they&#8217;ll reach me so. I do believe they will. And
I am needing such words more than ever lately. I
can hardly wait for them to come in letters. Though
I have the &#8216;invisible wall of love&#8217; to lean against,
that you told me of (and I <i>do</i> lean hard!), there
is an influence which tries always to drag me away
from that dear support, making it seem not to belong
to me after all. There&#8217;s a voice which tells
me I was never really loved by the one whose memory
I worship; that he asked me to marry him only
because mother practically forced him to do so. This
isn&#8217;t an <i>inner</i> voice. It&#8217;s the voice of a person
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>whose jealousy and cruelty I <i>must</i> forgive, or be as
cruel myself. The voice says it has reason to be sure
that all it tells me is true; that it&#8217;s useless for me
to ask mother, because she would deny it; besides,
she is too ill to be troubled or reproached about
anything. You know, I have two invalids now,
so I can&#8217;t do much for any one outside, except
send money&mdash;<i>his</i> money, to the poor and the
wounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;The terrible voice hammers constantly on my
heart, and is breaking it to pieces, in spite of your
help. For even you can&#8217;t help me there. How
could you, when about that one thing&mdash;that principal
thing of all, it seems now&mdash;you have no knowledge?
You can&#8217;t know whether <i>he</i> ever loved me
as a man loves one woman, or whether he was simply
willing to spread his generous protection round me
for the future, when he was going away to risk his
life. It would have been like him to do that, I have
to admit in some moods. And I hate the moods,
and hate the voice for putting the idea&mdash;which
mercifully hadn&#8217;t struck me before&mdash;into my head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>I oughtn&#8217;t to hate the voice, because it may be that
its wickedness&mdash;almost fiendish at times&mdash;is caused
only by hopeless suffering. I strive to say to myself,
as I think you would wish me to say, &#8216;Could a
bird who had been blinded and thrown into a cage
where it never saw sunshine, do better than croak,
or peck the hand that tried to feed it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need to walk with you in your garden, you see!
Send me kind thoughts from there, without waiting
to write. Then, if I send you questions in the same
way, I shall feel that you hear and answer. I shall
<i>listen</i> for the answers. Tell me, first of all, do you,
as a man, think another man would ask a girl to
marry him just because she was poor and without
prospects, and he was going away to face death?
Of course it&#8217;s true that you can&#8217;t know, but what
do you think? Remember, I&#8217;m not speaking of
an ordinary man, but one almost too generous and
chivalrous for these days. Do you think such an
one might have done that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Denin wrote back, &#8220;I think no man would have
done that. You need have no fear that you were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>married for any motive but love. A man&mdash;even
such a man as you describe&mdash;must have argued that
a young, attractive girl would have plenty of chances
in life, at least as good as that which he could offer.
She would have no need of his protection, and he
would have no right to press it upon her, unless he
gave all his love as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>This assurance Denin tried to send Barbara in the
way she asked, as well as by the letter which would
take weeks to reach its destination. He made of his
ardent thought for her a carrier pigeon with golden
wings, which could travel swiftly as the light.
Thus he rushed to her the answers to many questions,&mdash;questions
which seemed to come to him from far
off, as he walked in the garden. He could hear her
voice calling, when the wind came over the sea, from
the east where England lay.</p>

<p>Denin had bought the Mirador and begun his life
there, with some echo of Ernest Dowson&#8217;s words in
his mind:</p>

<p class='line'>Now will I take me to a place of peace:</p>
<p class='line'>Forget my heart&#8217;s desire,</p>
<p class='line'>In solitude and prayer work out my soul&#8217;s release.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>But his heart&#8217;s desire was with him, as it could
have been nowhere else, so vividly, flamingly with
him, that there could be no thought of finding peace.
He no longer even wished for peace. He would not
have exchanged a peace pure as the crystal stillness
of a mountain lake, for the dear torture of seeing
Barbara&#8217;s soul laid bare. He was never in a state
calm enough to analyze his feelings. He could only
feel. Yet the strangeness of his position and hers
swept over him sometimes, as with a hot gust from
the tropics. John Denin had had to die, in order
to learn that his wife adored him. The price would
not have been too big, if he alone had to pay, but
she was paying too. He could not take the payment
all upon himself; yet he could help to make it
less of a strain for her, and all his life was poured
into the giving of this help. Every thought, every
heart-beat was for Barbara. He lived to give himself
to her, and to take what she had for him in return.
With each day that passed he realized how
much more they were to each other at this vast distance&mdash;these
two, parted forever&mdash;than most men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>and women living side by side in legal union. He
knew that John Sanbourne was absolutely necessary
to Barbara Denin, as she was to him; and all the
incidents of their daily lives, big and small, though
lived separately, drew them together when recounted,
as pearls are drawn together on a lengthening
string.</p>

<p>Now that the secret was out, and Lady Denin
knew where John Sanbourne had made his home,
without suspecting any hidden mystery in the coincidence,
he was thankful that she had learned the
truth. A barrier was down, and they seemed to gaze
straight into each other&#8217;s eyes, across the space where
it had been. In return for his snapshots of the
Mirador and its garden, Barbara sent photographs
taken by herself of Gorston Old Hall. One of
these showed the lake, with a bow-windowed corner
of the black and white house mirrored in it&mdash;the
very spot where Sir John Denin had asked Barbara
Fay to be his wife. &#8220;The place I love best,&#8221; she
said. Though she did not say why, it thrilled him
to guess. And in the same letter she sent faintly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>fragrant specimens from the &#8220;Shakespeare border.&#8221;</p>

<p>How the sweetness of the dear old-fashioned
things, whose very names distilled a perfume, floated
back to Denin from the garden he had given to his
love!</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband had the border planted,&#8221; Barbara
explained. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it a delicious idea?
Not a single flower or herb mentioned by Shakespeare
has been forgotten, and you can hardly imagine
what a noble company has been brought together.
Once we walked in the garden, he and I,
on a moonlight night, when a breeze came up and
drove the evening mists slowly, slowly along the
paths and borders like a procession of spirits in silver
cloaks. We played that it had driven away the
ghosts of Shakespeare&#8217;s people, kings and queens
and knights and ladies called back to earth by the
perfume&mdash;which, you say, is the voice&mdash;of those
well-remembered flowers. That&#8217;s one of the memories
I cherish now, when I walk past the Shakespeare
borders in the moony dusk. And thanks to
you&mdash;who have helped me literally <i>to move into my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>dreams and live there</i>&mdash;I don&#8217;t seem to walk alone.
For a few moments then, I am neither lonely nor
sad. The moonlight still drips into my heart, like
water into a fountain, as it dripped on that night I
remember: and my thoughts lead me along a beautiful,
mysterious road that nobody else can see&mdash;a
road to wonderful things I&#8217;ve never known, but
have always longed for, such a road as certain music
seems to open out before you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pressed leaves and petals in Barbara&#8217;s letter
were those of pansies, rosemary, and rue: the
dark blue pansies he had once thought like her eyes
at night; rosemary for the never-absent remembrance
of them; rue for an ever aching regret, because of
what might have been and could not be.</p>

<p>She asked him to tell her what he had done inside
as well as outside of the Mirador since he had taken
it, and how he had furnished the rooms. This was
a difficult question to answer, because Denin had surrounded
himself with everything she had described
in her old environment: white dimity curtains, rag-woven
rugs of pale, intermingled tints, the &#8220;Mission&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>made chairs and tables, and copies of her old pictures
on the walls. If he detailed his chosen surroundings,
would not the added coincidence strike
her as almost incredibly strange?</p>

<p>Denin ignored the request in his following letter,
but Barbara repeated it in her next. &#8220;After all, it
isn&#8217;t possible that she should suspect the truth,&#8221; he
argued, and at last took what risk there was, rather
than appear secretive. Not that there <i>was</i> a risk,
he assured himself over and over again; yet when
a letter came which must be a reply to his, the man&#8217;s
fingers trembled on the envelope. In a revealing
flash like lightning which shows a chasm to a traveler
by night, he glimpsed a hidden side of his own
nature. He saw that it would be a disappointment,
not a relief to him, if Barbara passed over his description
of the new-born Mirador without stumbling
on any vague suspicion. He realized that he
must have been hoping for her to guess at the truth,
and so break the thin crust of lava on that crater&#8217;s
brink where they both stood, gathering flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God, I thought I had gained a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>strength!&#8221; he said, and opened the letter quickly,
though with all accustomed tenderness of touch.
Then he tried to be glad, and remind himself that he
had known it would be so, when he read that she
wondered only, without suspecting.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t been certain of it before,&#8221; she wrote,
&#8220;I should believe now that there are more things
in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy.
It <i>must</i> indeed be that our thoughts do
travel far, and impress themselves upon the thoughts
of others, for it can&#8217;t be a mere coincidence&mdash;as your
taking the Mirador was&mdash;that you have made the
place over again just as I had it. I must have gone
there in a dream, and told you things in your sleep.
Then you waked up, and supposed that the ideas
were all your own original fancies. The strangest
part is about the pictures. <i>I</i> had Rossetti&#8217;s &#8216;Annunciation&#8217;
in my bedroom. I chose it myself, because
of the lilies, and the little flames on the angel&#8217;s
feet. I chose &#8216;La Gioconda&#8217; too, because it seemed
to me that I should some day discover what made
her smile so secret, yet so enchanting, just as if, could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>one listen long enough, one might catch the tune in
the music of a brook or river. I used to stand before
the mirror of my dressing-table at the right
of the big window, and practise smiling like her, but
I could never manage it. I thought, if I could,
when I grew up I should be able to make a man I
loved fall in love with me, even if he didn&#8217;t care at
first. Poor child Me! I remembered that wish,
when I wanted the One Man to love me, and yet
was too proud and ashamed to try and make him do
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Downstairs I had Carpaccio&#8217;s dreaming St. Ursula,
with the tiny dog asleep, and the little slippers
by the bedside. And you have that picture hanging
almost in the same place! Yes, I must unknowingly
have cast some influence upon you. That
seems exquisite to me. I hope you do not mind?
If you don&#8217;t, I shall try again in other ways. Indeed,
I shall begin at once by influencing you to do
me a favor, I&#8217;ve been waiting a long time to ask,
and never quite found the courage to put into words.
Send me a photograph of yourself. I want it very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>much, to make sure that my mental picture of you
is right.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was hard to refuse the first request she had ever
spoken of as a &#8220;favor.&#8221; Denin was half tempted
to buy the portrait of some decent-looking fellow
and label it &#8220;John Sanbourne&#8221;; but only half
tempted. He could not lie to Barbara, and was reduced
to the excuse that he &#8220;took a bad photograph.&#8221;
It would be better for her to keep the friendly mental
picture she had painted, rather than be disillusioned.
&#8220;This sounds as if I were vain,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;but unfortunately I have every reason not to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Either she won&#8217;t care at all about not getting the
photograph, or else she&#8217;ll be offended,&#8221; Denin
prophesied gloomily. &#8220;Time will show.&#8221; And
when the day to which he had looked forward for
an answer burst upon him like a thunderclap, bringing
no letter, he thought that time had shown. She
was angry, or worse still, hurt, feeling that like
Psyche with the oil-dropping lantern, she had been
rebuked for curiosity. He saw himself losing her
again, through this small and miserable misunderstanding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>which he could not, must not, set right.
A second loss would be a thousand times worse than
the first, because this time her soul had belonged
to his soul. Their letters, their need of each other,
had circled them as if in a magic ring, or under a
glass case which, transparent to invisibility, had
housed them warmly together. A spiritual nausea
of fear, fear of loss, turned his heart to water, so
that over and over again he asked himself what to
do, without having power to answer.</p>

<p>He remembered the old fairy tale of Beauty and
the Beast, and how the Beast lay down despairingly,
to die in his garden, because Beauty, who had made
his life bearable, even happy, went away voluntarily
and for a long time forgot her promise to come
back.</p>

<p>The Mirador garden lost something of its old
spell for Denin. A glowworm which had come to
live at the end of the pergola, and evidently believed
in itself as a permanent family pet, was no longer
an intelligent and charming companion. He had
valued it only, he saw now, because he had meant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>to amuse Barbara by describing it to her, as his newest
friend. On nights when letters from her had
come, all the passion and romance of the world since
its beginning had streamed along the sea to his eyes,
by the path of the moon. But now the white light
had a hard, steely radiance that dazzled his eyes.</p>

<p>While the link held between him and Barbara,
it had been easy for Denin to feel kinship with
nature, with the world and worlds beyond. His
mind had traveled hand in hand with hers over the
whole earth and on, on to unknown immensities, as
rings from a dropped stone spread endlessly on the
surface of water.</p>

<p>Expecting answers from Barbara, he had had an
incentive to live, and had looked eagerly forward
to each new day, as to opening the door of a room
he had never seen before, a room full of beautiful
things, made ready for him alone. Now, when day
after day passed, bringing no word from her, the
rooms of the House of the Future were empty.</p>

<p>He had advised her, when she needed counsel,
to look and listen inside herself, for a voice. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>now, no such voice spoke to him, except to say,
&#8220;You have been a fool. You must unconsciously
have expressed yourself in some blundering way that
disgusted her, broke the statue she&#8217;d set up on a
pedestal. She is &#8216;disillusioned&#8217; indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>A week dragged itself on into a fortnight after the
day when Barbara&#8217;s answer ought to have come.
Still Denin had done nothing but wait, because it
appeared to him that no explanation of his seeming
ungraciousness was possible. If Barbara did not
want him any more, he could not make her want
him.</p>

<p>Had he not loved her so much, he might have
thought her silence due to illness; but he was sure
that he should know if she were ill. She had let
him walk into the home of her soul and its secret
garden of thought; she had offered him the flowers
of her childhood and girlhood which no one else had
ever seen; and if a blight had fallen upon her body,
he was so near that he would feel the chill of it in
his own blood. No, he told himself, Barbara was
not ill. She had shut herself away from him, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>was all; and the very nature of his relationship with
her forbade his claiming anything which she did not
wish to give.</p>

<p>He lost all hope of hearing again, at the end of a
month, yet would not let himself accuse her of injustice.
Had she not a right to drop him if she
chose? He had no cause for complaining. He had
received from the &#8220;tankard of love&#8221; those two drafts
which are said to recompense a man for the pains of
a lifetime, and he could expect no more. Yet he
seemed always to be listening, as if for some sound
to come to him through space, or even the faint echo
of a sound, like the murmur in a bell after it has
ceased to chime.</p>

<p>One day, when five weeks lay between him and
hope, a telegram was brought to the Mirador.
Denin opened it indifferently, for his publisher often
wired to him when a new edition of &#8220;The War
Wedding&#8221; came out, or if anything of special interest
happened in connection with the book. But
this time the message was from England. It was
unsigned, yet he knew that it was from Barbara.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>She said, &#8220;My mother has been at death&#8217;s door for
many weeks. Now she is gone. I am writing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; Denin heard himself gasp, and
then was struck with remorse for his hard-heartedness.
He had thanked God because Barbara had
not taken herself away from him, and in the rush
of joy had forgotten what it would mean for her
to be without her mother.</p>

<p>She was alone now with Trevor d&#8217;Arcy, at Gorston
Old Hall.</p>

<p class='line center mt3 mb2'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>CHAPTER XIII</p>

<p>Denin cabled an answer to Barbara, and then
began a letter to her. He was in the midst
of it, when he was disturbed by a caller, a man he
had never seen before. Expecting no one, the hermit
of the Mirador had been writing out of doors,
in the pergola, and so was caught without a chance
of escape. He sprang up and stood in front of the
little table on which were his paper and ink, as if to
protect the letter from the touch of a stranger&#8217;s eyes.
But the visitor, who had caught sight of John Sanbourne
through the network of leaves and flowers,
appeared blissfully ignorant that he was unwelcome.</p>

<p>He was tall, almost as tall as Denin himself,
though he looked less than his height, because of a
loose stoutness which hung upon him as if his clothes
were untidily padded. His large face, and the
whites of his eyes, and his big teeth, were all of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>much the same shade of yellow; and his hair, turning
gray, had streaks of that color under the Panama
hat which he did not remove.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good afternoon. I suppose you are Mr. Sanbourne?&#8221;
he remarked, in a throaty voice, with a
certain air of condescension which told that here
was no author-worshiping pilgrim. &#8220;My name is
Carl Pohlson Bradley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! How do you do?&#8221; replied Denin aloofly.
He wanted to go on with his letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty well, thank you,&#8221; responded the
other, accepting the suggested solicitude for his
health as fact, not a fiction of politeness. &#8220;I got
here this morning. Staying at the Potter, of course.
I been taking a look round the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Denin again. He could not think&mdash;and
did not much care to think&mdash;of anything else
to say. But the large yellow face changed slightly,
in surprise. &#8220;I expect you heard I was likely to
come, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Denin. &#8220;Not to my recollection.&#8221;
Then more kindly, &#8220;I&#8217;m rather a hermit. I go out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>very little, and have only a few callers. I don&#8217;t get
much news, except what I see in the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>was</i> in the papers.&#8221; The tone in which Mr.
Carl Pohlson Bradley gave this piece of information
suggested that his prominence was international as
well as physical.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can he be a New York reporter?&#8221; thought
Denin, his heart sinking.</p>

<p>But the caller had pulled from a pocket of his
brown tweed coat a newspaper, folded in such a
way as to make conspicuous a marked paragraph in
the middle column. This he handed to Denin as if
it had been a visiting card.</p>

<p>The paper was a local one, and the very first line
of the paragraph mentioned Mr. Carl Pohlson Bradley
as a St. Louis millionaire. It went on to state
that, having retired from business with a great fortune
at the early age of fifty-nine, Mr. Bradley intended
to buy an estate in California, as a winter
residence for his family. Having read so far,
Denin supposed that he had sufficiently informed
himself, and offered to give the paper back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>Bradley, however, waved it away. &#8220;Read the
rest,&#8221; he advised.</p>

<p>Denin did so, and with a shock learned that his
tall yellow visitor had become the owner of what
was still known as &#8220;the old Fay place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a surprise,&#8221; he said, not making any attempt
to look pleased. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t even know the
place was for sale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most places are, if the price is big enough to be
tempting. When I want a thing I&#8217;m willing to pay
for it. And that brings us to my call on you, sir. I
hear you&#8217;re an author, and have written a story
that&#8217;s sold about a million copies or some other big
figure which makes a lot of folks want to come here
and see what you&#8217;re like. But that isn&#8217;t what <i>I&#8217;m</i>
here for. I don&#8217;t read stories. I&#8217;ve called on business.
I want to know how much you&#8217;ll take to sell
me this bit of land you&#8217;ve bought on my place?&#8221;</p>

<p>Denin&#8217;s nerves had been on edge for the last few
weeks, and he felt an unreasonable impulse of anger
against the fat, self-complacent man. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
sell,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry if you don&#8217;t like having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>so near a neighbor, but I was on the spot first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what that&#8217;s got to do with it,&#8221; said
Bradley. &#8220;To my notion, this bit walled off from
my place is a regular eyesore. The Mirador, or
whatever they call it, is a rotten little den anyhow,
if you&#8217;ll excuse my saying so, more fit for a child&#8217;s
playhouse than a gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe it was built for a child&#8217;s playhouse,&#8221;
said Denin. &#8220;But it happens to suit me, though
I&#8217;ve never thought of dignifying it by the name
of &#8216;residence.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyhow, if you like a little bungalow, you
can buy a better one than this with more ground
around it, without troubling yourself to move a
mile,&#8221; Bradley persisted. &#8220;I&#8217;m no bargainer. As
I said just now, when I want a thing I&#8217;m willing
to pay for it. I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do, Mr. Sanbourne.
I&#8217;ll give you, for this little corner lot, as
you might call it, not only twice what it&#8217;s worth,
but the price of any other bungalow within reason
you choose to select. And I&#8217;ll pay your moving expenses,
too. Now, what do you say to that?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>&#8220;Just what I said before. I don&#8217;t wish to sell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, this is a holdup!&#8221; blustered the St. Louis
millionaire.</p>

<p>Suddenly Denin&#8217;s good temper came back, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you think I&#8217;m trying to &#8216;hold you up&#8217; for a
higher price!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I assure you I&#8217;m
not. If you offered me twenty thousand dollars I
wouldn&#8217;t accept.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; gasped Mr. Bradley. &#8220;Twenty thousand
dollars for this little rabbit hutch in a back
yard? Good Lord, it ain&#8217;t worth a thousand, at top
price.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to you, but it is to me. So, don&#8217;t you see,
it&#8217;s useless to argue further?&#8221; asked Denin, his eyes
still laughing at the big man&#8217;s ruffled discomfiture
and surprise that such things could happen between
a poor author and a millionaire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Argue! I didn&#8217;t come here expecting to argue!&#8221;
spluttered Bradley, looking like a bull stopped
at full gallop by a spider web. &#8220;I came here to&mdash;to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>&#8220;I quite understand, and I&#8217;m sorry to be disobliging,
but I&#8217;m afraid I must,&#8221; Denin cut in. &#8220;Anyhow,
I needn&#8217;t be inhospitable too. Will you
lunch with me, Mr. Bradley? I can&#8217;t offer you
much, but if we&#8217;re to be neighbors&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott, man, I&#8217;m staying at the <span class='sc'>Potter</span>!&#8221;
exploded Bradley, with a glance almost of
horror at the little table in the pergola where writing
materials had pushed aside dishes on a white
cloth already laid. The look contrasted John Sanbourne&#8217;s
hospitality so frankly with the fare awaiting
him at Santa Barbara&#8217;s biggest hotel, that
Denin laughed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if ever I change my mind
I&#8217;ll send you word. We&#8217;ll let it stand at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a reluctance pathetic in a man so large and
yellow, Bradley saw himself forced for the present
to swallow the humble author&#8217;s dictum. His jaundiced
eyes traveled over the little pink house, with
its balcony shaded by pepper trees, over the garden
which he had called a &#8220;corner lot,&#8221; and over the
simple pergola which for its owner was a &#8220;corridor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>of illuminated tapestry.&#8221; It seemed to Denin that
the man could have burst out crying, like a spoiled
child suddenly thwarted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re da&mdash; mighty foolish!&#8221; Bradley
amended, remembering the need to be conciliatory.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll think better of it. I&#8217;m sure
you <i>will</i> change your mind. I only hope for your
sake I won&#8217;t have changed <span class='sc'>mine</span> when that time
comes!&#8221;</p>

<p>On that he made a dramatic exit, with a mixture
of stride and waddle suited to one who felt that he
had had the last word.</p>

<p>When he had gone, Denin finished his letter and
forgot all about Mr. Carl Pohlson Bradley. Also
he forgot about luncheon. But that did not matter,
for his meals were movable feasts. He had them,
or did not have them, according to his mood, like
the hermit he was becoming. Mr. Bradley, however,
he was forced to remember at short intervals,
nearly every day, while he lived through the time
of waiting for the letter promised in Barbara&#8217;s cable.
&#8220;Changed your mind yet?&#8221; the new owner of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>&#8220;Fay place&#8221; would yell from his huge automobile,
spraying dust over John Sanbourne on the white
road to Santa Barbara. Or he would prowl, grumbling,
on the other side of the flower-draped barrier
which separated the Mirador garden from his
newly acquired property. At last he sent a lawyer
to his irritating neighbor with a definite offer of
twenty thousand, five hundred dollars&mdash;just temptingly
over the price Sanbourne had said that he
would not take. But Denin answered, &#8220;The
Mirador is my ewe lamb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When my mother was taken so desperately
ill,&#8221; Barbara wrote, &#8220;every moment had
to be for her, except those I could spare now and
then for the other invalid. I wanted to wire you;
but to do that seemed to be conceited, as if I took
your personal interest in me very much for granted.
I knew you would be too kind to laugh at anything
I did; but perhaps, in spite of yourself, the idea
might flash through your mind, &#8216;Poor thing, she telegraphs
because she has no time to write. She must
think I value her letters a lot!&#8217; This was just after
you had said that you wouldn&#8217;t send me your photograph,
you may remember. But no, why <i>should</i>
you remember? You will recall it now, though,
when I bring it up to you again. And if you do,
please don&#8217;t think I was foolish and small enough
to be offended or piqued. I wasn&#8217;t&mdash;oh, not for a
moment. I was only disappointed and a little&mdash;<i>let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>down</i>, if you know what I mean. I felt as if I
had been taking a liberty with the best and kindest
friend a girl or woman ever had, and laying myself
open to be misunderstood. I felt, if I followed up
that request by cabling to you that you mustn&#8217;t expect
letters for some time, it would be another blunder.
But oh, how I missed my friend!</p>

<p>&#8220;Two letters from you came to me, after I had
been obliged to stop writing, but because I&#8217;d been
able to send none, nothing seemed right. I felt as
if I had lost hold upon you. I groped for you in
the darkness, but because I had dropped your hand,
I was punished by not finding it again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother suffered so much that I could not wish
to keep her. For two days and nights after she
went, I lay in a kind of stupor. You see, I hadn&#8217;t
slept more than an hour out of the twenty-four, for
weeks, so I suppose I had to make up somehow, or
break. I was hardly conscious at all, and they let
me lie without rousing me up to eat or drink. But at
last I waked of my own accord, out of a dream, it
must have been, though I don&#8217;t remember the dream.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>I remember only that I thought you were calling me,
though the voice sounded like <i>his</i>. Immediately
after, I seemed to hear the words, &#8216;John Sanbourne
believes you&#8217;ve stopped writing to him because you
were vexed at his refusal of the photograph.&#8217; I
started up, tingling all over with shame, for I saw
that it might easily be true. I didn&#8217;t go to sleep
again. I asked for a telegraph form, and sent the
cable to you which I know you received next day,
because of the date of your answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg of you not to take your friendship away
from me. I shall need it more than ever now, if
possible, because my mother is gone. I don&#8217;t feel
that she will come back to me in spirit, because
she was unhappy here, and at the end was glad to
go. She loved me, I&#8217;m sure, but not in the way
which makes one spirit indispensable to the other.
I think after the war gloom of this world, and her
own pain, she will want to be very quiet and peaceful
for a while in beautiful surroundings, where she
can feel young and gay again, and not trouble herself
to remember that she was the mother of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>grown-up, sad woman down on earth. I want her
spirit to be happy in its own way, so I&#8217;m not even
going to try and call her to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;She looked no more than seventeen in her white
dress, in a white-lined coffin; and seeing her like
that, so young and almost coquettishly pretty, made
me realize why she had so bitterly regretted the
passing of her youth, and had clung desperately to
its ragged edges. I gave her a bed and a covering
of her favorite flowers, though they were not those
I care for most: gardenias and camellias and orchids.
I associate them always with hot-houses and florists&#8217;
shops, which seem to me like the slave markets of the
flower world&mdash;don&#8217;t they to you?</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg of you not to believe that I forgot, or did
not keep turning in thought to my friend, in those
long days and nights when I hadn&#8217;t time to write,
or couldn&#8217;t risk the rustle of a sheet of paper, or the
scratch of a pen. I thought of you constantly, especially
in the night when I sat beside mother, not
daring to stir or draw a long breath if she slept.
I reviewed all the past, since August 18th, 1914, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>as if I had been an outsider, saw myself as I was before
I read your book&mdash;before I wrote to you, and
gained your friendship for my strong prop.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a child in those days. I couldn&#8217;t face
grief and realize that it must be borne. All the
small, dear, warm, cushiony things of life as I had
lived it, seemed the only ones which ought to be
real. I clung to them. I wanted to shut out sorrow
and hide away from it by drawing rose-colored
blinds across my windows. I was a shivering creature
who had been caught in a sleety rain and soaked
through to the skin. I ran home out of the sleet,
thinking to pull those rose-colored curtains and put
on dry clothes and warm myself at the fire. But
the curtains had been ripped away. There were no
dry clothes, and no fire. There was no help or comfort
anywhere. The world marched in an army
against me. Only misery was real; in vain to writhe
away from it; it was everywhere. Horror and anguish
poured through me, as water pours into a leaking
ship. My soul was withering in the cold. The
bulwarks of my character were beaten down. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>you came into my life. You didn&#8217;t give me back
my rose-colored curtains to hide the face of sorrow,
but you taught me how to look into sorrow&#8217;s eyes,
and find beauty and wonder beyond anything I had
ever known. You let me creep into a temple you
had built, and learn great truths which you had
found out through your own suffering. I knew you
had written your book with your heart&#8217;s blood, or
you couldn&#8217;t have made my heart fill with life and
beat again. You couldn&#8217;t have reached me where
I was cowering, far, far below tear-level.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even when I could see by your letters that you
hadn&#8217;t quite been able to shake off chains of depression
from yourself, you had the power to release
others. What a splendid power! Did you
realize that you had it, when you wrote your book,
I wonder?</p>

<p>&#8220;You showed me what to do with the strange
forces I could feel blindly groping in my soul. You
showed me that philosophy shouldn&#8217;t be a brew of
poppies to drown regrets, but a tonic, a stimulant.
You taught me that hope must live in the heart, because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>hope is knowledge wrapped up in our subconsciousness,
and spilling rays of light through the
wrappings. You gave me the glorious advice not to
waste life, which must be lived, by trying to kill
Time, making him die a dull death at bedtime every
night, but to run hand in hand with him&mdash;run wherever
he might be going, because things worth while
might be ready to happen round the very next bend
of the future.</p>

<p>&#8220;This was the lesson I needed most, because I&#8217;d
forgotten that if there was no intimate personal joy
left for me in this world, there was for others; and
even I might help them to find it, by having the
bright courage of my imagination, instead of the
dull courage of convictions.</p>

<p>&#8220;You made me believe (even though I can&#8217;t always
live up to the belief) that when we are horribly
unhappy, we&#8217;re only seeing a beautiful, bright
landscape reflected gray-green, in our own little
cracked and dusty mirror, distorted in its cramped
frame. While Mother was ill, and other troubles
pressed on me heavily, I often reminded myself of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>those words of yours, in a many-times-read letter;
and I tried to turn my eyes away from the poor
cracked mirror, dim with the dust which I had stupidly
thought was the dust of my own destiny;
tried to look instead at the clear truth of things.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the same letter (one of those I treasure most;
for I&#8217;ve kept all, and always shall keep them) you
gave me another thought that has done me good.
You said it had only just come to you as you wrote
to me. Do you remember? You were wondering
if our Real Selves (the &#8216;realities behind the Things&#8217;
you&#8217;ve spoken of so often) exist uninterruptedly on
the Etheric Plane, to be joined there by the souls of
the earthbound selves, each time they finish with
their bodies. &#8216;Imagine the soul arriving from earth,
pouring its new experiences into the mind of its Real
Self,&#8217; you said, &#8216;and receiving in return memories of
all it had ever lived through, learning the reason
<i>why</i> of every sorrow and joy, and never quite forgetting,
though it might think it had forgotten.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I thank you, my friend, for every mental
growing pain you have given me! Instead of forgetting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>what I owed you, in those weeks of silence,
I realized it all more and more, and resolved to be
worthier of my lessons when the strain on my new
strength increased, as it is bound to do, with mother
gone. I shall try, that&#8217;s all I can say. I don&#8217;t
know how I shall win through. And I shall have
more to thank you for, if you tell me that our friendship
hasn&#8217;t been disturbed by my seeming ingratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see those queer little dried-up Japanese
flowers which seem utterly dead till you throw
them into water? Then they expand and remember
that they are alive. I am one of them. Don&#8217;t
pour off the water. I&#8217;m afraid if you did, I might
be weak enough to dry up again.&#8221;</p>

<p class='line center mt3 mb2'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>CHAPTER XV</p>

<p>To get back the jewel he had thought lost, was
to be born into a new life in a new world.
Denin had to tell the portrait in the redwood frame,
what he felt, for he dared not tell Barbara herself.
To have given her a glimpse of his heart would have
been to show that its fire had not been kindled by
friendship. His answer to her letter was so tame,
so lifeless compared to the song of his soul, that it
seemed something to laugh at&mdash;or to weep over.
But there was a line he must not pass. He knew
this well, and that his only happiness could be in
the Mirador and in Barbara&#8217;s friendly letters, as
long as she cared to write. Mr. Carl Pohlson Bradley
might go on bidding for the Mirador up to a
million if he liked. There was no chance of his
getting it! Denin was as sure of that, as he was
of the shape of the world, or perhaps a little surer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>Then, one day, a thunderbolt fell in the garden. It
was dropped by the postman, in the form of a letter.</p>

<p>Barbara wrote, &#8220;Everything is changed since I
wrote you six days ago. I can&#8217;t live here any longer,
under the same roof with a man whose one pleasure
is to torture and insult me. I haven&#8217;t spoken
about him to you lately. There was no need, but
things grew no better between us&mdash;worse, rather, for
he resented the calmness I was finding through you.
It made him furious apparently, that he had no longer
the same power over me as at first, to drive me
away from him, crying, or shaking all over with
shame and anger at the dreadful things he said. I
hardly cared at all of late days, when he called me
a hypocrite, or a liar, or a damned fool, or other
names far worse. I paid him a visit morning and
evening, or at other times if he sent for me, and went
out motoring or driving with him when he felt well
enough to go. He refused to move without me, and
so, as the doctor ordered fresh air for him, I couldn&#8217;t
refuse. When he was at his worst&mdash;or what I
thought the worst then&mdash;I could look straight ahead,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>and think of things you said, hardly bearing his
abuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;This is my &#8220;bit&#8221; to do in the war days,&#8217; I reminded
myself, and thought maybe my kind of fighting
was almost as hard to do as the fighting in the
trenches. Besides, I never lost sight of what you
answered when I first told you how hard it was,
living up to obligations I&#8217;d taken on myself. You
said, &#8216;We&#8217;re all sparks of the one Great Fire, some
brighter than others. We can&#8217;t hate each other for
long without finding out that it&#8217;s as bad as hating
ourselves.&#8217; Truly, I quite brought myself to stop
hating him. I only pitied, and tried to help, as
much as he would let me. But I see now that it
was all in vain. I can&#8217;t do him any good by staying,
and&mdash;well, I just simply can&#8217;t bear it! He is
too ill to be moved. This dear old house will have
to be his home while he drags on his death in life&mdash;which
may mean years. So I, not he, must go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lest you should blame me too much, I will tell
you what happened, though I wasn&#8217;t sure I would
do so when I began to write.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>&#8220;His valet is a trained nurse, a repellent person,
though competent, with dull eyes and a face which
looks as if it had petrified under his skin, because his
soul&mdash;if any&mdash;belongs to the Stone Age. The
creature&#8217;s name happens to be Stone, too; and if he
has any feeling it is love of money. His master has
been bribing him, it seems, to spy upon me. While
I was away from the house, at my mother&#8217;s funeral,
Stone was searching the drawers of my desk in the
octagon study I&#8217;ve told you about, where I like to sit
because it was my dearest one&#8217;s favorite room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had never thought of hiding your letters.
There was nothing in them which needed to be hidden.
Besides, it never occurred to me that cruel suspicions
and disgusting ideas of baseness were wriggling
round me, like little snakes that peep out from
between the rough stones in a ruined wall. There
they all were, bound together in a packet, the kind,
brave letters that have been my salvation! Stone
took them to his master, who sent for me when I
came home after the funeral.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as I saw him, I knew that something unusual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>had happened. He flung his &#8216;discovery&#8217; of
the letters into my face. He told me that he had
burnt all but a few which he would keep to &#8216;use&#8217;
against me, and tried to frighten me into promising
never to write to &#8216;this John Sanbourne&#8217; again. Of
course I gave no promise. Instead, I told him that
what he had done and said freed me from him forever.
Then I went out of the room and left him
there, helpless on his sofa. For the first time I felt
no pity for him whatever&mdash;not so much as I should
feel for a crushed wasp who had stung me. I
haven&#8217;t seen him since. I don&#8217;t intend to see him
again. But when I could get my thoughts in order
after the fire of fury had cooled a little, I wrote
to him. I said that I was sending for a lawyer, and
would make some arrangement so that he should
want for nothing. I told him that he might stay
at Gorston Old Hall as long as he wished, but that
I was going away almost immediately. Once gone,
I should never return while he was in the house. I
have always thought divorce very dreadful; but now
I see how one&#8217;s point of view changes when one&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>own interest is at stake. If I could, I would divorce
this man, with whom my marriage has been a tragic
farce. But I have no case against him legally. I
knew when I consented to call myself his wife, that
I should never be his wife really, and so, my solicitor
says, I could not even sue for nullity of marriage.
It wasn&#8217;t I who thought of that. I don&#8217;t remember
having heard the term mentioned, though perhaps
I have, without noticing, when such things
seemed as far from my life as the earth from Mars.
It was the lawyer who brought up the subject, but
added the instant after, that nothing could be done,
in the way of legal separation of any kind. He advised
me to send the man away from Gorston Old
Hall, saying that I should be more than justified.
But I wouldn&#8217;t agree to do that. For one thing, it
would be like physical cruelty to a wounded animal.
For another thing&mdash;even a stronger reason&mdash;the
<i>temptation</i> to send him away was&mdash;and is&mdash;terribly
strong.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could feel myself trying to justify the idea
to my own soul, as if I were pleading a case before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>a tribunal. I could hear myself argue that it was
unfair to let such a man enjoy the home of my Dearest,
whom he had already superseded too long. But
I knew, deep within myself, that my Dearest would
be the very one of all others to say, &#8216;Let him stay
on,&#8217; if he could come back and speak to us. In that
same deep down, hidden place, was the knowledge
of my real reason for wanting the man to go. To
move him might easily break off the thread of his
life. <i>That</i> was the temptation: to do a thing which
might seem just to every one who heard the circumstances,
and to get rid of the intolerable burden&mdash;to
be absolutely free of it as I could be in no other
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of my own self, I&#8217;m afraid I couldn&#8217;t have resisted
the temptation. I should probably have
thrown all responsibility on my solicitor, and let him
settle everything as he thought best. The strength
to resist has come through you, and what you have
taught me. So it is that this man who has insulted
you, and burned your letters, owes his comforts and
perhaps his life itself, to you.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>&#8220;There are many things which it is hard to forgive
him, but I think the hardest of all is the loss
of the letters. To lose them is like losing my talisman.
But the ones he was keeping as a threat, I
shall have again. The solicitor says he will force
the man to give them up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that my leaving this dear house is settled,
the next question is, What shall I do with my life,
since my services as an untrained nurse are no longer
pledged here? Already, though only a few days
have passed, I&#8217;ve decided how to answer that question.
I shall go into some hospital as a probationer,
and as soon as I am qualified, I shall offer my services
to the Red Cross. That may be sooner than
with most amateurs, for already I&#8217;ve learned almost
as much about nursing as hospital training of a
year could have taught me. Wherever I&#8217;m sent,
I&#8217;m willing to go. But before I take up this new
work, I have a plan to carry out. Oh, how I wonder
what you will say to it!</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a few weeks before she went out of the
world, a cousin of my father&#8217;s left Mother some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>property in California, quite valuable property, near
Bakersfield. I don&#8217;t know if you have ever been
there, but of course you&#8217;ve heard that it is a great
oil country. There are big wells on this property.
If it had come to Mother earlier, she would have
been overjoyed, because it would have made all the
difference between skimping poverty and comparative
riches. It came too late for her, and for me it
isn&#8217;t very important, so far as the money is concerned.
There&#8217;s another thing that makes it important,
though. The place is in California! It
seems like mending a link in a broken chain, to own
land in dear California again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother always said she would hate to go back,
but I never felt like that. Now, it seems to be
rather necessary for me to go&mdash;or to send some one,
to look into things which concern the property. We
hear there has been mismanagement&mdash;perhaps dishonesty.
Of course I know nothing about business
myself, and should be of no use. But if I went to
California, I would engage some good lawyer on the
spot, to take care of my interests: and, <i>I could meet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>you</i>, my friend. That is, I could if you were willing.
Would you be? Would you welcome me if I
came one day to the gate of the little garden, and
begged, &#8216;Dear Hermit of the Mirador, will you give
a poor tired traveler lunch in your pergola?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see now that the legacy is only an excuse.
I confess it. I shouldn&#8217;t go to California just to
straighten out things at the oil fields&mdash;no, not even
if I lost the property by not going. But to see my
friend who has given me back life, and love in the
sweetness of memory and hope of future usefulness,
I would travel with joy across the whole world instead
of half.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you refused to send your photograph, because
I &#8216;might be disillusioned.&#8217; But I <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> be
disillusioned, because there&#8217;s no illusion. Do I care
what your looks may be? If you are ugly, I&#8217;m
sure it&#8217;s a beautiful, brave ugliness. Anyhow, <i>I</i>
should think it so. Please, therefore, don&#8217;t put me
off for any such reason as you gave about the photograph.
It isn&#8217;t really worthy of you, or even of
me. Let us dare to be frank with each other. I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>told you how much I want to see you and what it
would mean to me. In return you must tell me
whether you want me to come, or whether, because
of some <i>real</i> reason (which you may or may not
choose to explain) you wish me to stay away.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you get this, there will be only time to
telegraph to&mdash;Yours ever in unbreakable friendship,
Barbara Denin.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a great wind wailing over the
sea, on the day that Barbara&#8217;s letter was
brought to Denin. The wind seemed to come from
the four corners of the earth, laden with all the
stormy sorrow of the world since men and women
first loved and lost each other. The voice was old
as death and young as life, and the heartbreak of
unending processions of lovers was the message it
brought to the Mirador garden. Denin knew because
he had heard through the fire-music of life,
that there was another voice and another message
for those who would listen. He knew that higher
than tragedy rang the notes of endless triumph;
that the message of love went on forever beyond
the break of the note of loss. He knew the lesson
he had so hardly taught himself and Barbara:
that happiness is stronger than sorrow, as all things
positive are stronger than all negative things. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>the big truths of the universe were too big for him
that day. The thought that he might see Barbara,
and yet must not see her, shut out all the rest.</p>

<p>There had been, it seemed, only one honorable
course open when he had decided to sacrifice his
place in life to save Barbara from scandal and to
let her keep her happiness. It was very different
now. Her marriage with Trevor d&#8217;Arcy had not
been a marriage of love. It had been worse than a
failure. She had loved only one man, John Denin.
Why not let her come and find him?</p>

<p>But no, the trial would be too great. It would
not be fair to put the girl, still almost a child, to
such a test. Her love for Denin had been a delicate
poem. He had died, and his memory was cherished
in her heart, as a rose of romance. There was no
human passion in such a gentle love, and only the
strongest passion could pass through the ordeal he
proposed. She might hate him for his long silence,
and blame him for deceit. She would see herself
disgraced in the eyes of the world, and nothing that
he could give would repay her for all that she must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>lose. No love could be expected to stand such a
test, much less the love of a child for an ideal which
had never, in truth, existed. It would break her
heart to fail, and break his to have her fail. The
memory of a meeting and a parting would be for
him a second death&mdash;death by torture. The temptation
to let things take their course was overcome.
Indeed, he no longer felt it as a temptation; nevertheless
he suffered.</p>

<p>Some reason for putting her off must be alleged,
but there was time to think of that afterwards, between
the telegram and letter which would follow.
The great thing was to prevent her from coming to
the Mirador, and finding out what a tragic tangle
she had made of her life.</p>

<p>When he had sent the cable, and was at home
again, Denin read once more all of Barbara&#8217;s closely
written pages. At the end he kissed the dear
name with a kiss of mingled passion and renunciation.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll think I have no more heart than a stone,&#8221;
he said to himself. &#8220;Her friendship for Sanbourne
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>will crumble to pieces.&#8221; Ineffably he longed to
keep it&mdash;all that he had in life of sunshine. Yet he
could not see how to account for his refusal without
lying, and without appearing in her eyes cold as a
block of marble. He looked at the letter&mdash;which
might be her last&mdash;as a man might look at a beloved
face about to be hidden in a coffin: and suddenly
the date sprang to his eyes.</p>

<p>For all his reading and re-reading he had not
noticed it before. There had been a delay. The
letter had been several days longer than usual in
reaching him. What if she had grown tired of
awaiting the asked-for cable, and had chosen to take
silence for consent?</p>

<p>The certainty that this was so seized upon Denin.
He was suddenly as sure that Barbara was on the
way to him, as if he had just heard the news of her
starting. If, honestly and at the bottom of his
heart he wanted to save her a tragic awakening from
dreams, he must leave nothing to chance. He must
be up and doing. It was not impossible, even if she
had waited four days for a cable, and started impulsively
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>off on the fifth, that she might walk in at
the gate of the Mirador garden, a week from that
night, so Denin hastily calculated. How was he
to be gone before she came&mdash;if she did come&mdash;without
humiliating the dear visitor by seeming deliberately
to avoid her? How could John Sanbourne&#8217;s
absence be accounted for in some reasonable and impersonal
way, if Lady Denin arrived at Santa Barbara
enquiring for him?</p>

<p>In his need of a pretext, he recalled the offer
which he had laughed at; Carl Pohlson Bradley&#8217;s
offer to buy the Mirador in its garden. The man
would snap at the chance to get his way so soon.
In a few days the business could be settled, and
Sanbourne could be gone. But where? And
Denin sought anxiously to provide the &#8220;good reason&#8221;
at which he had hinted to Barbara, in his cable
forbidding her to come.</p>

<p>Even if he had sold the Mirador before receiving
his friend&#8217;s letter, he might have waited to see her.
He could have stayed on in a hotel, if the new
owner of the place had been impatient. No, selling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>his house was but one step of the journey. What
should the next one be?</p>

<p>Almost instantly the solution of the whole difficulty
presented itself to his mind. A few days before,
he had sent a subscription to a fund for organizing
a relief expedition to Serbia. The appeal
had come to John Sanbourne through his publisher.
And even as he wrote his check, he had thought, if
it were not for the exquisite bond of friendship which
tied him to a fixed address&mdash;the address of the
Mirador&mdash;how easy it would be to give himself as
well as his money, to the cause of Serbia in distress.
Not only doctors and nurses were wanted for the
expedition, but men of independent means, able to
act as hospital orderlies and in other ways.</p>

<p>Physically, Denin had not yet got back the full
measure of his old strength. After all these months,
he would be of no use as a fighting man. He limped
after a hard walk; and often with a change of
weather he suffered sharp pain, as if his old wounds
were new. But he could stand a long journey, and
surely he would be equal to the work of an orderly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>perhaps something better. If there were dangers to
meet in Serbia, he would welcome them, whatever
they might be. To die would be to adjust things
as they could be adjusted in no other way. Since
August 18, 1914, John Denin had had no right to
live.</p>

<p>The more he thought of it, the wiser seemed the
Serbian plan. With Bradley&#8217;s money, he could do
five times more for the Red Cross fund than he had
hoped to do. What mattered the wrench of parting
from the Mirador? The only thing that really mattered,
as before, was saving Barbara from pain.
She would not be hurt if she came and found him
gone on such an errand as this, for it was one which
could not wait. Later, she would understand even
more clearly, for he would write a letter and send
it to Gorston Old Hall, where some servant would
have been given a forwarding address. Thus he
need not quite lose his friend. She would forgive
his going away, and write to him in Serbia.</p>

<p>Denin calculated that Barbara could not have
sailed from England until at least five or six days
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>after sending her letter to him. Probably she would
not have sailed so soon. Apparently, when writing,
she had only just made up her mind that Gorston
Old Hall was unbearable. There would have been
many things to arrange, and business to settle with
her solicitor, friends to say good-by to. She could
not possibly reach Santa Barbara even if she traveled
with the most unlikely haste, until the end of
the week. That she should arrive on Saturday
would be almost a miracle. It was Monday now,
and Thursday might see him away from the place
where he had dreamed of passing all his days. Now
that he had thrown off the dream, he saw it a fantastic
vision. As vigor of body and mind came
back to him, the boundaries of the Mirador garden
would soon, in any case, have become too narrow
for his energies. He would have found it necessary
to shoulder some useful burden, and work
with the rest of the world. The hour had struck
for him now, and John Sanbourne had got his
marching orders, as John Denin had got them long
ago.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>He sent word to Bradley through his lawyer, that
the Mirador was for sale, after all. Next, he telegraphed
to the leader of the Serbian Relief Expedition,
in New York, and asked if there was a place
for him. Because the name of John Sanbourne was
known, an enthusiastic answer came back with great
promptness. This stirred Denin&#8217;s heart, which,
despite his firm resolution, felt heavy and cold. He
thought of Barbara coming to the Mirador, only to
find Mr. Bradley&#8217;s workmen engaged in tearing
down the barrier between the big garden and the
little one. But now that his course of action was
decided, he supplemented his first cable to her with
another. This was in case his &#8220;presentiment&#8221; were
wrong, and she had not started. He told her what
his &#8220;good reason&#8221; was: that he had sold the Mirador
and was starting at once for Serbia. Further
explanations, he added, would be given when he
wrote.</p>

<p>Never had a letter to Lady Denin been so difficult
for John Sanbourne to compose, for he could say
only the things he least wished to say; and so the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>result of his labor was, in the end, very short. Nevertheless,
it took hours to write.</p>

<p>The day after the sending of the letter was largely
taken up by a visit from Carl Pohlson Bradley and
his man of business. Denin held the millionaire to
the last price named by himself, for he intended to
use the money largely for the benefit of the Serbian
Red Cross. At last a contract was signed, and the
check paid into John Sanbourne&#8217;s bank at Santa
Barbara. He had still all Wednesday and part of
Thursday for packing and disposing of his treasures.
The task was easy, for the treasures were
few. He could &#8220;fold his tent like an Arab, and
silently steal away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denin did not expect ever to return to Santa Barbara.
Having loved the Mirador, and given it up,
there was no longer anything tangible to call him
back. More likely than not, death which had come
close to him in France, would come closer still in
Serbia. He would cast off his body like an outworn
cloak, and free of it, would knock once more at the
gate where, once, he had heard voices singing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>The one possession which Denin could not bear
to give up, yet knew not how to take, was the portrait
of Barbara which he had made, and framed in
redwood. It was large, and the delicate tints of its
pastels had to be carefully protected. He could not
possibly include it in his slender &#8220;kit&#8221; for Serbia.
At last he decided to pack frame and all with precaution,
carry the case to New York, and leave it in
charge of Eversedge Sibley. There would be time
for a visit to Sibley before the sailing of the expedition;
and Denin would make his friend promise
to burn the wooden box unopened, if he died abroad.</p>

<p>Everything else, with the exception of some favorite
books which could be slipped into his luggage,
he determined to give away. Gossip about the sale
of the Mirador, and Sanbourne&#8217;s intended departure
for Serbia, ran like quicksilver, in all directions.
The acquaintances he had made&mdash;or rather acquaintances
who had fastened upon him&mdash;began calling to
enquire if the news were true, and their question answered
itself before it was asked. The hermit of
the Mirador and his faithful dumb companion, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>pipe, were surrounded with the aimless confusion of
a hasty flitting. Souvenirs of John Sanbourne had
their value, but he did not appear to know that. He
offered his Lares and Penates recklessly, to any one
who would accept. The parson&#8217;s daughter, to
whom&mdash;all unconsciously&mdash;he was an ideal hero,
took away the pictures, copies of those the child
Barbara had loved. The parson himself got a valuable
contribution of books for his library. The furniture
was given to a young couple who had taken a
bungalow not far off, and were getting it ready with
an eye to economy. Dishes and linen went the same
way, excepting a cup and saucer and teapot which
were clamored for with tears by an old lady for
whom &#8220;The War Wedding&#8221; ranked with the Bible.</p>

<p>Denin had allowed no one to enter the balconied
bedroom, for he had left Barbara&#8217;s portrait until the
last minute, and no eyes but his were to see that
sacred thing. Once the picture was shut away and
nailed up between layers of cotton and wood, it
might be that he should never again be greeted by
the dear, elusive smile. The furniture from upstairs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>he had added to the confusion of the sitting-room
below, and early in the afternoon of Thursday
everything had been carted away by the new owners.
To strip the house while Sanbourne was still
in it seemed heartless, they had protested; but he had
begged them to do so. Mr. Bradley was to claim
possession of the place next day.</p>

<p>When all those who called themselves his friends
had bidden him good-by, a curious sense of peace, of
pause between storms, fell upon the departing hermit
of the Mirador. Because the little house was
almost as empty and echoing as on the day when he
had seen it first, that day lived again very clearly
in Denin&#8217;s mind. He had sought a refuge, and had
found happiness. The spirit of Barbara had come
to him in the garden, and had brought him love.
That love he was taking away with him, though he
had to leave behind much that was very sweet; and
now the time had come to say farewell to the memories
of months. In three hours the motor car was
due, which Denin had ordered to take him and his
luggage to the station. The most important piece
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>of that luggage was Barbara&#8217;s portrait, and it had
still to be put into its case. But he was leaving the
farewell to her eyes, till the last moment, the last
second even.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he walked in the garden, and in the
jeweled green tunnel of the pergola. There, in the
pergola, he had read most of Barbara&#8217;s letters, and
answered them. He was glad that no one was ever
likely to stroll or sit in the corridor of illuminated
tapestry after to-day. Carl Pohlson Bradley intended
to have the pergola pulled down, and the
whole place torn to pieces in order to carry out the
grandiose scheme of a &#8220;garden architect&#8221; whom he
had employed.</p>

<p>After the arrival of Barbara&#8217;s first letter, and the
one in which she confessed her love for the dead John
Denin, his sweetest association with the pergola was
the companionship of a little child&mdash;only a dream
child, but more real, it seemed, than any living child
could be. It was the child-Barbara who had walked
day after day, hand in hand with him in the pergola.
She had welcomed him to the Mirador when he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>come as its owner; but after a certain letter from
England, she had changed in a peculiarly thrilling
way. The letter was among the first half dozen;
but in the growing packet, Denin kept it near the
top. It was one of those which he re-read oftenest.
In it Barbara had said to her friend, John Sanbourne,
&#8220;If my dear love had lived, to make me his wife,
perhaps by this time we should have had a baby with
us. I think often of that little baby that might
have been&mdash;so often, that I have made it seem real.
It is a great comfort to me. I can almost believe
that its <i>soul</i> really does exist, and that it comes to
console me because its warm little body can never
be held in my arms. I see the tiny face, and the
great eyes. They are dark gray, like its father&#8217;s.
And when mine fill with tears, it lays little fingers on
them, fingers cool and light as rose petals. Oh, it
<i>must</i> exist, this baby soul, for it is so loving, and
it has such strong individuality of its own! I
couldn&#8217;t spare it now. Already, since it first came
and said, &#8216;I am the child who ought to be yours and
his,&#8217; it seems to have grown. It is the <i>realest</i> thing!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>Its hair is darker and longer and curlier than it used
to be. Perhaps this baby will always stay with me,
and I shall see it grow into boyhood, then, at last,
into manhood. It&#8217;s wonderful to have this dream-baby!
Tell me, have you ever had one? I know
you are alone in life, for you have said so. But
the more alone in life one was, the dearer a dream-baby
might be.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that letter, which pierced Denin&#8217;s heart and
then poured balm into the wound, the child-Barbara
who haunted the Mirador had changed for him, except
in name; or rather another child-Barbara had
come, not a child of ten or twelve, but a baby thing
with smoke-blue eyes and little satin rings of ruddy
hair. The elder Barbara did not go away, but loved
the baby as he did, helping him teach it how to walk,
and talk, and think.</p>

<p>He wrote to Lady Denin after that letter of hers:
&#8220;Yes, I too have a dream-child, but mine is a little
girl. I hardly know how I got on without her before
she came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven for memory!&#8221; he said to himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>now, as he took his last look at the tunnel of
greenery starred with passion-flowers. &#8220;After all,
does it so much matter whether we had a beloved
thing one minute ago, or ten years ago, if it lives
always in our hearts? Each tick of the watch
turns the present into the past. But in our hearts
there is no past.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he bade good-by to the pergola, and the garden
he had made out of a tangled wilderness. Then
he turned towards the house; for in the house he had
to take leave of the portrait.</p>

<p class='line center mt3 mb2'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>CHAPTER XVII</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get out here, please!&#8221; said a woman in black,
stopping the automobile which had brought her
from the railway station within sight of the Fay
place. She was tall and slender, and apparently
young, but her mourning veil was so thick that it
lay like drifting coal-smoke between her face and the
curious stare of the chauffeur.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a quarter of a mile to the gate yet. And
I shan&#8217;t charge any more to take you right to it,&#8221; he
explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know&mdash;thank you!&#8221; his passenger said. &#8220;But
I want to walk the rest of the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had a pretty way of speaking, though rather
a foreign sort of accent, he thought. Perhaps it was
English. Her luggage had been left at the station,
so she was free to do as she pleased, if it amused
her to spoil her shoes with the white dust of the road.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>She paid the price agreed upon, and a dollar over,
which the chauffeur acknowledged with a &#8220;Thank
you, miss!&#8221; As he turned and drove away, however,
he wondered if he ought to have called her
&#8220;miss.&#8221; To be sure, she had the air of a girl; but
her manner was grave. He didn&#8217;t know one sort
of mourning from another; but being a foreigner
like as not she was one of them war widows over
there.</p>

<p>The tall young woman walked fast at first, as if
she were in a hurry. Through the dark fog of her
veil she looked at everything, gazing at each tree as
if she recognized it, and at each flowering creeper
that flooded the wall of the &#8220;Fay place&#8221; with color.
She passed the main gateway, and went on without
hesitation; but as she came near the small gate
of the Mirador garden, her pace slackened. She
moved very slowly; then fast again; and just outside
the gate she stopped, the bosom of her black
dress rising and falling as if she were out of breath.
It was as though she were afraid to go in at the
gate. But after a minute of breathing hard she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>recovered herself, and opened it, almost noiselessly.</p>

<p>The path on the other side was arched over with
pepper trees. The woman in black closed the gate
and latched it very gently, almost tenderly. A few
berries, like beads of pink coral from a child&#8217;s necklace,
lay on the old gold of the path. She tiptoed
along to avoid treading on them. Presently the
path was interrupted by a short flight of old brick
steps, and at the top it went on again. In a moment
the little pink house was in sight, backed by a
great jade-green olive tree, touched with silver in
the slanting light of afternoon. The garden was a
lovely riot of flowers. It looked sweet and welcoming,
with an old-fashioned welcome, but no one
was there.</p>

<p>The woman&#8217;s heart beat, then missed a beat. She
threw back her veil, and her face shone out white
and beautiful as the moon shines suddenly through
a torn black cloud. It was the face of a girl, but
the eyes were the eyes of a woman. They wandered
over the garden, then focussed on the house.
The open windows were curtainless. There were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>no chairs under the balcony which gave a shady roof
to the front door. Instead, a few odds and ends of
broken crockery and disorderly wisps of straw lay
scattered here and there. Despite the welcoming
charm of the garden, there was an air of desolation
about the place, which struck at the woman&#8217;s heart.
Hesitating no longer, she walked quickly up the
path, and paused only at the open door of the little
pink house.</p>

<p>Even there she stopped only for a few seconds.
The room inside was stripped of furniture. There
was no need to knock. The woman walked in and
looked through the door of the &#8220;parlor&#8221; into the
kitchen where a child had once cooked dinners for
her dolls. It also was empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone!&#8221; The word dropped from her lips. She
did not know that she had spoken until a whispering
echo of emptiness answered. Suddenly she realized
that she was very tired, more tired than she had
ever been in her life before. She seemed to have
come to the end of the world, and to have found
nothing there but a stone wall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said, and covered her face with her
hands, shivering, though the sun outside the deserted
house was warm. When her hands fell, there
were no tears in her eyes, but they were like blind
eyes yearning for sight.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that the house was trying to tell
the secret of what had happened. Stripped as it
was, she had the impression that it was full of intelligence
and kindness. She listened at the foot of
the stairs. Perhaps the owner of the house had not
really gone yet. Perhaps he was up there. Perhaps
for some reason he had to leave this place, but
was waiting for Some One he expected. Surely that
must be so! Surely he would not go away, just at
this time?</p>

<p>When she had listened, and heard nothing, she
called his name, softly at first, then more loudly.
But there was no answer. If he were in the room
above, he must have heard. Oh, the poor little room
with the balcony, where a child had looked out over
the garden, and played that fairies lived in the olive
trees!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>The girl was slightly made and light of foot, but
she went up the steep steps heavily, like a weary
woman who feels herself old, very old. The door
of the balconied bedroom was shut. Maybe, after
all, he might not have heard her call! She knocked,
once, twice, then turned the knob and timidly pushed
open the door. She could see nothing inside the
room but a packing-case, with a wooden cover
propped against it, and a box of bright new nails
beside it on the bare, tiled floor.</p>

<p>The intruder stepped over the threshold, and saw
that, at the further end of the room out of sight from
the door, stood a small leather portmanteau&mdash;pathetically
small, somehow&mdash;and a still smaller suitcase.
He had not gone, then!&mdash;and she had no right to
be here, in his room. She turned hastily to go out,
and facing the door&mdash;blown partly shut by the
breeze from an open window, she also faced a portrait
framed in a wonderful frame of ruddy, rippled
wood, like the auburn hair of a woman. The eyes
of the portrait&mdash;smoke-blue eyes&mdash;looked straight
into hers. And as she looked back into them, it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>like seeing herself in a mirror, a mysterious mirror
which refused to reflect her mourning clothes, and
gave her instead a white dress.</p>

<p>This was so strange a thing, that the girl could not
believe she really saw it. She thought that she must
be asleep in the train, on the way to Santa Barbara,
and that in her eager impatience she had dreamed
ahead. This would explain the deserted house.
She was only dreaming that she had walked up the
garden path, and had found her friend gone&mdash;gone
to avoid her. How <i>like</i> a dream!&mdash;the strain to
succeed, and then failure and vague disappointment
wherever one turned! How like a dream that her
portrait should be found hanging in a marvelous
frame, in the house of a man who had never seen
her, never even had her description! She would
wake up presently, of course, and find herself shaking
about in the train. How glad, how glad she
must be that this was a dream, because when she
did indeed come to the Mirador, there would be
curtains and furniture and pictures and books, such
as John Sanbourne had written about, and John
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>Sanbourne himself would be there expecting her!
Still, it was astonishing that the dream went on and
on being so vivid. She could not wake up!</p>

<p>As she stared at the eyes of the portrait, hypnotized
by them, a stronger breeze slammed the door
shut. Now she would surely wake! Noises always
waked one. They had no place in dreams.
But no. The scene remained the same, except that
the handle of the door was being slowly turned.
Some one was opening it from the outside. The
dream was to go on, to another phase. The girl
clasped her hands, and pressed them against her
breast. So she stood when the door opened wide,
and a man, stopped by the sight of her, stepped back
in crossing the threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barbara!&#8221;</p>

<p>The name sprang to Denin&#8217;s lips, but he did not
utter it.</p>

<p>He had meant to go away in time. He had tried
to spare her this; yet he had in his secret heart
thought that, if she did come, it would be heaven to
see her. But now it was not so. There was one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>brief flash of joy in her beauty; then horror of himself
overpowered it. Her very loveliness seemed to
make his guilt more hateful&mdash;a lifetime of guilt!
He saw himself as the murderer of this girl&#8217;s youth
and happiness. It seemed to him that no man had
ever sinned as he had sinned. He had crept away
and hidden in the dark when she most needed him.
Defenseless, she had in all good faith married another
man. And because of his weakness she had
sinned against the law. She had done a thing
which, if known, would ruin her life in the world
she knew. It was his fault, not hers, yet she had suffered
for it, and now she would suffer more than
she had suffered yet. If she had thought she loved
the dead man, from this moment she would hate the
living one, who had deceived her.</p>

<p>Yet there was one hope. Perhaps he was even
more changed than he had supposed, and if he went
away instantly without speaking, she might not recognize
him. He stepped back, on the impulse, but
she held out her hands, as he turned to go, and cried
to him piteously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>&#8220;Oh, if you are a dream,&#8221; she said, in a low,
strange voice, &#8220;stay! I beg of you to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still he did not speak. He could not, now. He waited.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all a dream,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I know that.
Coming here&mdash;to the empty house&mdash;finding my own
picture&mdash;and then&mdash;then&mdash;when I looked for John
Sanbourne, seeing you&mdash;my love! O God, let me
never wake up in this world. If this could only be&mdash;what they
call death!&#8221;</p>

<p>The word broke, to a sob, and she swayed towards
him, deathly white. Denin sprang forward,
and caught her in his arms&mdash;his wife&mdash;the first time
he had ever held her so. Then, because he could
think no longer, but only feel, he kissed her on hair
and eyes and lips, and strained her to him with every
worshiping name he had given her in his heart since
their wedding and parting day.</p>

<p>She lay so still against him, that it seemed she
must have fainted; but her eyes opened, drowned in
his, as he kissed her on the lips. He saw the blue
glitter, as if two sapphires blocked his vision, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>suddenly his face was wet with Barbara&#8217;s tears.
&#8220;Have I died?&#8221; she whispered. And the tears which
were damp on his face were salt on his lips as he
whispered back, &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>He remembered how he, too, had once thought
himself dead, and then had crept slowly back to life.
He had seen Barbara then, as in a dream within a
dream. Now she, too, was passing through this experience.
He held her tight. He could not let
her suffer as he had suffered when he came back
to life! Yet what could he do for her, after all?
The sense of his helplessness was heavy upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Barbara, darling! I never
meant this to happen. The first I heard of you&mdash;after&mdash;was
that you&#8217;d married&mdash;your cousin. I believed
you loved him. I was in a German hospital&mdash;broken to pieces&mdash;disfigured.
I ought to have
died, but somehow I couldn&#8217;t die. I had to live on.
Later, I escaped. I came here&mdash;where <i>you</i> had
lived. God knows, all through I tried to do for the
best&mdash;your best. Nothing else mattered. I wrote
that book&mdash;for you, only for you! And you know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>the rest. You turned my hell to heaven. I was&mdash;almost
happy, except for what you suffered. But I
dared not have you come here. I cabled. I was
going away&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She pressed her head back against his shoulder,
and looked up at him. &#8220;You were going&mdash;&#8221; The
words burst from her on a high note of sharp reproach,
but she caught them back with a sigh of
joy. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t go!&#8221; she breathed. &#8220;God
wouldn&#8217;t have let you go. He put it in my heart
to leave England the day after I wrote. Ah, we&#8217;re
not dreaming, and we&#8217;re not dead! We&#8217;re alive,
and we love each other better than all the world.
I know now that you do love me, or you couldn&#8217;t
hold me and kiss me so. You couldn&#8217;t have made
such a sacrifice&mdash;the sacrifice of your very life and
self for me. It was like you&mdash;like you! The mistake
was my fault, not yours. But I&#8217;ll make up to
you for it all, and you will make up to me. We&#8217;ll
never part for an hour again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re saying, Barbara,&#8221;
he reminded her. &#8220;John Denin&#8217;s dead. We can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>bring him back to life. Too many interests are involved,
yours first of all, but others, too. It would
be selfish and cruel for me to take you so&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t take me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I give myself,
I give myself to John Sanbourne, as I gave myself to
John Denin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ll be poor,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;John Denin&#8217;s
money can&#8217;t come to us&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have enough of my own now. And if I hadn&#8217;t,
I&#8217;d beg with you. We could be tramps together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denin laughed out joyously, almost roughly, and
clasped her tight. &#8220;It won&#8217;t come to that, my
darling! Perhaps I can write another book. Yes,
I can! It shall be called &#8216;The Honeymoon.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go away somewhere,&#8221; Barbara implored,
&#8220;where nobody will know us, and we can love each
other in peace till we die: for we belong to one another
in God&#8217;s sight and our own. Yes, till we die.
And afterwards&mdash;afterwards! Oh, you have taught
me that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have pledged myself to go to Serbia,&#8221; Denin
said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go to Serbia with you, that&#8217;s all!
What does it matter where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the world&mdash;and Gorston Old Hall?&#8221; he
heard himself asking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither do they matter. Nothing matters but
you. And God will understand&mdash;because I am <i>your</i>
wife, and belong to no one else, or ever, ever did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; Denin answered, holding her
very close. &#8220;God will understand. You&#8217;re mine,
and I&#8217;m yours, and nothing shall part us again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The portrait with the smoke-blue eyes smiled at
them from the door. They saw only each other: but
the eyes in the picture Denin had painted seemed to
see beyond the place where the milestones end.</p>
